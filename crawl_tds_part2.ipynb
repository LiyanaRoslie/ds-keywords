       "      <td>Lee Schlenker Mar 1, 2020·7 min read In the rush to prepare management for artificial intelligence, both Academia and CorpEd are spinning together programs of statistics, information technology, and information sciences to train future professionals for commerce and industry. Lost in the shuffle is the need to address both how AI is transforming management practices today, and how it will impact careers in management in the foreseeable future. Let’s take a moment to underline the obvious- most managers will never become data scientists, but all managers need to look beyond the data and the algorithms to explore how artificial intelligence is transforming the essence of management. What do business and engineering students need to understand about AI in Management? In the first contribution of this three-part series, we examined how AI influences the foundations of corporate strategy, the need to address the concept of “AI readiness”, and the specificities of AI project management.[i] In this contribution, we will look at three additional foundations of AI in a business setting: the importance of fostering Collaborative Intelligence, the need to improving Managerial Decision-Making, and the implications of Digital Transformation. The future of business does not belong to chatbots, cybots and cobots, but to managers that have learned to adapt organizations to leverage new forms of human-machine collaboration. Collaborative intelligence refers to the design of networks of human and machine agents that play to their mutual strengths in fostering the crowdsourcing of knowledge, expertise, and preferences. Management alone can define the division of labor between human and machine agents and establish the rules that govern acceptable behavior. As algorithms demonstrate their value in automating repetitive tasks, managers prove their worth in understanding how and where to match human and machine intelligence. Management will need to encourage both communication and meaning in discussions that will be increasingly both asynchronous and virtual. Last but certainly not least, managers will be held accountable for resolving the inevitable conflicts that will arise when algorithms are used to address the complexity of human interaction. If the goal of artificial intelligence is to enhance human potential, it’s management’s responsibility to discern what it means to be human. Training management to nurture collaborative intelligence can focus on how to operationalize an “augmentation strategy” efficiently and effectively.[ii] Case studies on the theme can explore the challenges of leveraging the network effects of human and machine agents in dotted-line organizations where managers and employees act as independent contractors. Workshops can focus on the practice of change management and challenges of designing patterns of transformation that regulate the pace of change. Far from the mechanics of data and algorithms, management must be prepared to encourage their ecosystems to leverage AI to co-develop human and machine intelligence. Machine agents will never be any better than the computer program behind them Automated decision-making provides a case in point. On the upside, algorithms promise us more efficient processes and more consistent decisions that will allow managers more time to focus on improving the business. On the downside, machine agents will never be any better than the program behind them. In cases where the agents rely on deep learning algorithms integrating artificial neural networks or support vector machines, the how and the why of each decision can prove very difficult to explain. Their output will be continuously challenged as being unfair, illegal, or erroneous. As a result, regulations like Europe’s GDPR require companies to provide specific justification for each algorithmic-based decision affecting employment, health, purchasing or credit. Human and machine agents will need to develop collaborative intelligence in communicating both with each other and with consumers. Managers don’t act on data, but on their perceptions of the what the data represents. Machine learning is about developing algorithms capable of learning from data, elucidating patterns and connections, and providing insights in supporting human decision-making. Yet in decision science, we learn that the major challenges to decision-making are human perceptions of the complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty of the environment in which we take decisions. In the cognitive sciences, we explore how our pre-conceptions and prejudices distort how we see the problem and limit our ability to propose innovative solutions. Studying artificial intelligence in isolation is as short-sighted as it is useless, for practitioners need to understand the complexity and the diversity of human decision-making. Programs on managerial decision-making can focus on where and when machine learning can help managers transform data into action. Coursework can help participants understand the role of modeling, the nature of specific decision environments, and the impact of cognitive biases in the data, algorithms, and logic. Case studies can elucidate the place of heuristics and algorithms in perception, prediction evaluation, and insight. As a whole, there programs can be designed to develop the participants’ ability to “solve” business problems through the analytic method: evaluating the context, identifying the roots of the problem, evaluating the quality of the data, choosing the right methodology to address the problem, and creating the conditions for collective action. As long as we purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm B2C Marketing provides multiple examples of the complexity of managerial decision-making. AI modeling and simulation techniques can certainly be leveraged to construct relevant buyer personas and to predict consumer behavior trends.[iii] Yet as long as human beings purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm. Each marketing decision requires understanding customers’ needs, appreciating the temporal impact of the of community, culture and economy on consumption, and aligning each organization’s product and service offer. Decision environments, cognitive biases, and consumer preferences inherently influence how individuals and organizations view the data at hand. B2C Marketing isn’t a question of data and outcomes, but of the processes of perception, prediction, evaluation, and insight that influence consumption and production. [iv] The term digital transformation suggests that digital technology provokes fundamental changes in how businesses deliver value to their stakeholders. Although the concept originally reflected a vision of transforming « atoms to bits » it has evolved over the last decade to encompass a mindset about how managers and their stockholders view their businesses. Digital transformation is not about hardware, software and data, but rather technology’s role in providing management insight into what’s core to the business, and how their organization works with customers. As importantly, experience demonstrates that digital technologies don’t change companies and markets, people do. The current objectives of digital transformation: the use of AI and machine learning, the adoption of digital operating models, the creation of new digital partnerships, and the evaluation of a company’s digital assets, underline the importance of management training in any digital initiative. Coursework can help participants understand that digital transformation isn’t an « IT project » any more than the responsibility for its success lies with the Data Science or IT teams. Case studies can provide ample room for debate and discussion around the role of management in setting an appropriate vision for each project, as well as pertinent methodologies and evaluation metrics in specific contexts. Workshops can provide the necessary room to explore the need to foster cultures of risk taking and overcome organizational barriers to change. If these companies view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers Platform business models like Airbnb, Uber or Amazon provide ample food for thought. Although each make extensive use of artificial intelligence, the value of each case is neither in the data they capture nor in the algorithms they use. They view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers. [v] When analyzing the impact of digital transformation inside these companies we need to look beyond their digital infrastructure to explore how their data practices support their business models, business processes, and revenue streams. The value of their business can not be calculated as the sum of their material and immaterial resources, but in how their vision of digital transformation has encouraged both their customers and employees to think differently about doing business. Training in Artificial Intelligence today needs to help managers look beyond data and algorithms and explore how AI has transformed organizations and markets. The future success of business endeavors doesn’t depend on AI, but managers capable of leveraging digital technologies to enhance human potential. In this contribution we have addressed three themes that should be at the core of any Data Science program: Collaborative Intelligence, Managerial Decision-Making, and Digital Transformation. In each vision, management skills rather than just technical savvy prove fundamental in aligning the promise of AI with each organization’s strategy, resources, and culture. In the final contribution in this series on the role of management in AI we will look at the importance of Digital Ethics and AI’s influence on innovation.[vi] Lee Schlenker is the Principal in the BAI http://baieurope.com and Professor of Business Analytics and Community Management.

       "      <td>Robert Wood Mar 1, 2020·2 min read Whether you’re a data scientist, data analyst, or software engineer; and whether you have a strong handle on NLP tools and approaches, if you’re here, you’ve likely wondered how a chatbot works and how to build one, but haven’t ever had the need or chance. Well… you’re here now, so let’s get it done. You’ll be surprised to find you’re likely familiar with what goes into creating your own chatbot It may be to query a simple database, make an order, reservation, customer service, and much more. We interact with chatbots every day. Chatbots are all about what’s called a rule matching engine. In the simplest form; that pretty much means that when you get a message, what do you do with it? One way you could do this is just by repeating back what was originally typed. While it seems overly simple and uninteresting, this idea serves as a good foundation before you branch into more complexity with your chatbot. Let’s get our hands dirty def parrot_talk(incoming_message): bot_response = \"Hi, my name is Randy the Parrot, you said: \" + message return bot_response print(parrot_talk(\"hello!\")) Obviously that’s a simple example, let’s take it up a notch. responses = { \"Hello\": \"Hey! How can I help you?\", \"I need a refund\": \"I'm happy to help, can you give me more detail?\" } def respond(message): if message in responses: return responses[message] respond(\"I need a refund?\") Similar to what you saw the first time, here is a customer service chatbot. What we’re doing in the above dictionary is establishing keys that should relate to what our customers might say… those keys then map to an appropriate response. Now obviously the limitation here is that it would require the message to be exactly the same as the key in the dictionary. We can very quickly become far rigorous, using things like regular expressions on any given message, creating a flag to indicate the presence of various terms in the text &amp; then keying off of that flag to populate our response. To take it even further, we could deploy ML algorithms that could predict whether or not a message falls under a given intent or topic which we could then map back to the dictionary of appropriate responses. Have you ever seen the auto responses in LinkedIn? You should try to have a conversation by just tapping those prompts… beyond being fun, it’s an interesting exploration in the sophistication as well as the lack thereof. Among the toughest things for chatbots is the ability to track the state of any given conversation, which will be very obvious once you go and have that chat in LinkedIn. Chatbots are surprisingly simple to create at first glance. Happy Data Science-ing!</td>\n",

How do you debug the code to identify and resolve the root cause? Logging is the process of recording the flow of code as it executes along with capturing any other events that occur during execution like Out Of Memory(OOM) issues or hard disk issues. Logging is usually done in files that can be retrieved later for analysis or troubleshooting. Using logs, we can capture the key information in the classes and function of our code. Log helps with What should you capture as part of the logs that will help to troubleshoot? Logs should be very detailed containing a descriptive message containing How to implement logging in Python? Python provides a library “logging” to write messages to a file or any other output stream like the standard output. Different levels of logging in the order of their severity A simple code to use logging and different severity options We log message structure is severity level like WARNING, followed by the default logging module root, followed by the message. We see that debug and info messages are not displayed. Logging module by default only displays messages with a severity level of warning and above What if you are debugging the code and want to show the messages for severity levels of Debug and Info? We use basicConfig() to set basic configuration for the logging system. basicConfig() will not take new settings into considerations if the root logger is already configured. I had to restart my kernel for the above code to work properly as the first time any of the logging function is called it configures the root logger internally. Common basicConfig() parameters filename: Specify the filename to which we want to write the log message filemode: Specify the mode in which the file needs to be opened like ‘w’ for write, ‘a’ for append. Default file mode is ‘a’ format: Specify the format string available as attributes in LogRecord datefmt: Specify the date format we want in the log messages. The format should be accepted by time.strftime() level: Severity level that you want to set for the root logger The following code snippet will demonstrate logging in classes and function. We create a TestLog class with the divide(); it takes two parameters and returns the division. In case there is an error in the division, we want to have the stack trace in the log file Creating an instance of the TestLog class and calling divide() For displaying a stack trace, we need to set exc_info as True in the except block of the Exception handling as done in the TestLog class Logging helps troubleshoot the application during development or after production deployment. Logging can be written in files or standard output using multiple formats, and we can also capture the stack trace. docs.python.org https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html</td>\n",

       "      <td>Quinn Wang Mar 1, 2020·7 min read You might have used the Random Forest Algorithm for your data science projects and it performs very well with little effort, especially on heterogeneous data. A random forest is made up of an ensemble of decision trees. While each decision tree is easy to interpret — split order and threshold tell a lot about what the tree is prioritizing and how it's making decisions — the ensemble of trees is more of a black box. In a binary classification problem, a random forest classifier generally works better than a decision tree classifier. This can be explained by the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution B(n, p) is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success. Given a binomial distribution, we can easily find the probability of exactly k, 0≤k≤n, successes from the probability mass function. Define X as the random variable that follows B(n, p), then Pr(X = k) is given by: Where: Which is the probability of k successes with probability p, and n-k failures with probability 1-p, scaled up by all combinations of which successes and failures can be ordered. Then for any k and p: This equation means that the probability of success for more than half of the trials is greater than the probability of success for each individual trial. When translated to “forest language”, this is saying: assuming each tree in the forest is independent of one another and the probability of making the correct prediction from each tree is constant and greater than 50%, then the probability of more than half of the trees giving the correct predictions is greater than the probability of any individual tree making the correct prediction. A key assumption here is the independence between any two decision trees in the forest. In reality, when trees are trained using the same dataset, this assumption is improbable to be satisfied. Hence introducing randomness. The idea is that if we incorporate stochasticities into the build of each decision tree, they will be more independent of one another. Stochasticities are introduced by methods such as: Learning about these randomnesses will help us understand, or at least tame, the black box a little better. Sometimes when we replicate results, certain procedures might be overlooked because we assume they wouldn't affect the model's performance. Then we might be stuck at figuring out why our results didn't match expectations, and that is a really frustrating process because there are so many things that could potentially go wrong. The randomness I listed above is very well known in the random forest algorithm. Therefore, when someone writes a report about his/her model he/she would likely make sure readers don't get different results because of these randomnesses. To tackle each: So the above randomness can be avoided by simply disclosing all hyperparameters. However, there is another place where potential randomness may occur: whether we include a set of constant features. When I first started using the random forest algorithm, I completely overlooked the impact of constant features, and was very confused when including a set of constant features changed my model's performance. It shouldn't matter whether a set of constant features are included, right? Nodes cannot split on a constant feature because every data point takes the same value. As a result, constant features are never used as a splitting criterion in a decision tree. If we print out the feature_importances_, we will see that importance is always zero for any of these features. Nodes just examine them and discard them. The problem lies in how nodes deal with these features: examine, and then discard. Let's say max_features is set to five, when building tree T (a tree we randomly select to take a closer look at) in the forest: the root of T is going to select five features in a sequence predetermined by the total number of features and random_state. It will then pick the best one to split from, and split into two child nodes. This process repeats for each child node and eventually terminates if one of the limitations set by our hyperparameters is met, or if the node is pure (containing data from only one class). Let's say we train T with 100 non-constant features, and suppose the predetermined feature indices are [2, 99, 53, 15, 76] for the root node, [17, 22, 23, 81, 59] for its left child, and [47, 34, 65, 16, 67] for its right child. For simplicity of illustration, assume the usefulness of a feature increases as the index increases. Additionally, assume that max_depth is set to two. The set of three features T ends up splitting by is [99, 81, 67]. Now if we add 50 constant features, and assign them ids 100 to 149. Say the predetermined sequence with 150 total number of features is [104, 134, 85, 29, 3] for the root node, [0, 39,124, 91, 56] for its left child, and [94, 20, 100, 4, 80] for its right child. Since a splitter ignores a constant feature when it sees one, features with id ≥ 100 will not be picked even though they take up space as one of the five features a node can examine. The set of three features T ends up splitting by in this scenario is [85, 91, 94], which is different from the first scenario and is an overall more useful set. What happened to T generalizes to all trees in the forest, and will hence change the forest’s performance. Adding constant features affects feature usefulness in two ways: In conclusion, whether a set of constant features is included will affect a forest's performance. In a way, having a lot of constant features will add more randomness to the forest, because at each node, the max_features is effectively changing randomly. Beware of this effect next time you consider constant features as irrelevant.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Reuben Kavalov Mar 1, 2020·5 min read Welcome to the next exciting chapter of my reinforcement learning studies, in which we’ll cover temporal-difference learning. As always I’ll link to the resources that taught and guided me at the bottom of the post. In my last two posts, we talked about dynamic programming (DP) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Temporal-difference (TD) learning is a kind of combination of the two ideas in several ways. Like MC, TD learns directly from experiencing episodes without needing a model of the environment. Like DP, TD learning can happen from incomplete episodes, utilizing a method called bootstrapping to estimate the remaining return for the episode. Basically put, it is making a guess of the value function, taking some steps, and then making another guess, updating our original guess towards this new one. where Gₜ is the return and α is a constant step-size parameter. We look at the error term between our estimated value and the return, and update our value function in the direction of that error. The simplest version of TD learning is TD(0) or one-step TD, which updates the value function towards the estimated return after one step. That estimate, like in the Bellman equation, consists of two parts: the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the next step. Now we can substitute this estimated return for our real return Gₜ, to come up with an estimated, biased algorithm. Let’s see how TD methods might prove advantageous over MC methods with an example. The idea of the example is making predictions on how long it will take to get home from work. Here is the sequence of states, times, and predictions. How can we update our value function based on this trajectory of experience? The following visualizations make the difference between MC and TD methods clear. On the left, we see the changes recommended by MC methods. Since we update each prediction based on the actual outcome, we have to wait until we get to the end and see that the total time took 43 minutes, and then go back to update each step towards that time. With TD learning, as seen on the right in the above diagrams, at every step, after taking a step, we can immediately update the previous step. A major advantage of TD learning is that it learns even without knowing the final outcome. After all, it is entirely possible for an agent to receive incomplete sequences, or even work in continuing environments that don’t actually have a final outcome. By substituting TD in for MC in our control loop, we get one of the best known algorithms in reinforcement learning. The idea is called Sarsa. We start with our Q-values, and move our Q-value slightly towards our TD target, which is the reward plus our discounted Q-value of the next state minus the Q-value of where we started. Sarsa uses every element of the quintuple of events that describes the transition from one state-action pair to the next. Starting to get an inkling of where it got its name from? Let’s take a look at the pseudocode of the Sarsa Algorithm for On-Policy TD Control: To bring this to life, we’ll take a look at an example that may seem familiar, Windy Gridworld. Windy Gridworld is the same as the gridworld we came to know and love in previous posts, but with a twist: there is a crosswind running up the middle of the grid! The strength of the wind varies column by column, represented by the numbers underneath each column. The strength indicates the numbers of cells shifted upwards after taking an action. For example, if in the cell directly to the right of the goal, taking the action of moving left will put you in the space directly above the goal. An important thing to note is the fact that Monte Carlo methods may not work here, as a policy may be found that causes the agent to stay in the same space, effectively making the next episode never-ending. Using Sarsa allows us to learn within the episode that such a policy is poor, and will try something else. Next time, I will be diving into Q-learning for off-policy TD control, where we will be approximating the optimal state-value function independently of the policy followed, similarly to how is done in off-policy MC methods. Thanks very much for reading, I look forward to learning more in this fascinating sub-realm of machine learning.

       "22444  Lee Schlenker Mar 1, 2020·7 min read In the rush to prepare management for artificial intelligence, both Academia and CorpEd are spinning together programs of statistics, information technology, and information sciences to train future professionals for commerce and industry. Lost in the shuffle is the need to address both how AI is transforming management practices today, and how it will impact careers in management in the foreseeable future. Let’s take a moment to underline the obvious- most managers will never become data scientists, but all managers need to look beyond the data and the algorithms to explore how artificial intelligence is transforming the essence of management. What do business and engineering students need to understand about AI in Management? In the first contribution of this three-part series, we examined how AI influences the foundations of corporate strategy, the need to address the concept of “AI readiness”, and the specificities of AI project management.[i] In this contribution, we will look at three additional foundations of AI in a business setting: the importance of fostering Collaborative Intelligence, the need to improving Managerial Decision-Making, and the implications of Digital Transformation. The future of business does not belong to chatbots, cybots and cobots, but to managers that have learned to adapt organizations to leverage new forms of human-machine collaboration. Collaborative intelligence refers to the design of networks of human and machine agents that play to their mutual strengths in fostering the crowdsourcing of knowledge, expertise, and preferences. Management alone can define the division of labor between human and machine agents and establish the rules that govern acceptable behavior. As algorithms demonstrate their value in automating repetitive tasks, managers prove their worth in understanding how and where to match human and machine intelligence. Management will need to encourage both communication and meaning in discussions that will be increasingly both asynchronous and virtual. Last but certainly not least, managers will be held accountable for resolving the inevitable conflicts that will arise when algorithms are used to address the complexity of human interaction. If the goal of artificial intelligence is to enhance human potential, it’s management’s responsibility to discern what it means to be human. Training management to nurture collaborative intelligence can focus on how to operationalize an “augmentation strategy” efficiently and effectively.[ii] Case studies on the theme can explore the challenges of leveraging the network effects of human and machine agents in dotted-line organizations where managers and employees act as independent contractors. Workshops can focus on the practice of change management and challenges of designing patterns of transformation that regulate the pace of change. Far from the mechanics of data and algorithms, management must be prepared to encourage their ecosystems to leverage AI to co-develop human and machine intelligence. Machine agents will never be any better than the computer program behind them Automated decision-making provides a case in point. On the upside, algorithms promise us more efficient processes and more consistent decisions that will allow managers more time to focus on improving the business. On the downside, machine agents will never be any better than the program behind them. In cases where the agents rely on deep learning algorithms integrating artificial neural networks or support vector machines, the how and the why of each decision can prove very difficult to explain. Their output will be continuously challenged as being unfair, illegal, or erroneous. As a result, regulations like Europe’s GDPR require companies to provide specific justification for each algorithmic-based decision affecting employment, health, purchasing or credit. Human and machine agents will need to develop collaborative intelligence in communicating both with each other and with consumers. Managers don’t act on data, but on their perceptions of the what the data represents. Machine learning is about developing algorithms capable of learning from data, elucidating patterns and connections, and providing insights in supporting human decision-making. Yet in decision science, we learn that the major challenges to decision-making are human perceptions of the complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty of the environment in which we take decisions. In the cognitive sciences, we explore how our pre-conceptions and prejudices distort how we see the problem and limit our ability to propose innovative solutions. Studying artificial intelligence in isolation is as short-sighted as it is useless, for practitioners need to understand the complexity and the diversity of human decision-making. Programs on managerial decision-making can focus on where and when machine learning can help managers transform data into action. Coursework can help participants understand the role of modeling, the nature of specific decision environments, and the impact of cognitive biases in the data, algorithms, and logic. Case studies can elucidate the place of heuristics and algorithms in perception, prediction evaluation, and insight. As a whole, there programs can be designed to develop the participants’ ability to “solve” business problems through the analytic method: evaluating the context, identifying the roots of the problem, evaluating the quality of the data, choosing the right methodology to address the problem, and creating the conditions for collective action. As long as we purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm B2C Marketing provides multiple examples of the complexity of managerial decision-making. AI modeling and simulation techniques can certainly be leveraged to construct relevant buyer personas and to predict consumer behavior trends.[iii] Yet as long as human beings purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm. Each marketing decision requires understanding customers’ needs, appreciating the temporal impact of the of community, culture and economy on consumption, and aligning each organization’s product and service offer. Decision environments, cognitive biases, and consumer preferences inherently influence how individuals and organizations view the data at hand. B2C Marketing isn’t a question of data and outcomes, but of the processes of perception, prediction, evaluation, and insight that influence consumption and production. [iv] The term digital transformation suggests that digital technology provokes fundamental changes in how businesses deliver value to their stakeholders. Although the concept originally reflected a vision of transforming « atoms to bits » it has evolved over the last decade to encompass a mindset about how managers and their stockholders view their businesses. Digital transformation is not about hardware, software and data, but rather technology’s role in providing management insight into what’s core to the business, and how their organization works with customers. As importantly, experience demonstrates that digital technologies don’t change companies and markets, people do. The current objectives of digital transformation: the use of AI and machine learning, the adoption of digital operating models, the creation of new digital partnerships, and the evaluation of a company’s digital assets, underline the importance of management training in any digital initiative. Coursework can help participants understand that digital transformation isn’t an « IT project » any more than the responsibility for its success lies with the Data Science or IT teams. Case studies can provide ample room for debate and discussion around the role of management in setting an appropriate vision for each project, as well as pertinent methodologies and evaluation metrics in specific contexts. Workshops can provide the necessary room to explore the need to foster cultures of risk taking and overcome organizational barriers to change. If these companies view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers Platform business models like Airbnb, Uber or Amazon provide ample food for thought. Although each make extensive use of artificial intelligence, the value of each case is neither in the data they capture nor in the algorithms they use. They view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers. [v] When analyzing the impact of digital transformation inside these companies we need to look beyond their digital infrastructure to explore how their data practices support their business models, business processes, and revenue streams. The value of their business can not be calculated as the sum of their material and immaterial resources, but in how their vision of digital transformation has encouraged both their customers and employees to think differently about doing business. Training in Artificial Intelligence today needs to help managers look beyond data and algorithms and explore how AI has transformed organizations and markets. The future success of business endeavors doesn’t depend on AI, but managers capable of leveraging digital technologies to enhance human potential. In this contribution we have addressed three themes that should be at the core of any Data Science program: Collaborative Intelligence, Managerial Decision-Making, and Digital Transformation. In each vision, management skills rather than just technical savvy prove fundamental in aligning the promise of AI with each organization’s strategy, resources, and culture. In the final contribution in this series on the role of management in AI we will look at the importance of Digital Ethics and AI’s influence on innovation.[vi] Lee Schlenker is the Principal in the BAI http://baieurope.com and Professor of Business Analytics and Community Management.

                  Robert Wood Mar 1, 2020·2 min read Whether you’re a data scientist, data analyst, or software engineer; and whether you have a strong handle on NLP tools and approaches, if you’re here, you’ve likely wondered how a chatbot works and how to build one, but haven’t ever had the need or chance. Well… you’re here now, so let’s get it done. You’ll be surprised to find you’re likely familiar with what goes into creating your own chatbot It may be to query a simple database, make an order, reservation, customer service, and much more. We interact with chatbots every day. Chatbots are all about what’s called a rule matching engine. In the simplest form; that pretty much means that when you get a message, what do you do with it? One way you could do this is just by repeating back what was originally typed. While it seems overly simple and uninteresting, this idea serves as a good foundation before you branch into more complexity with your chatbot. Let’s get our hands dirty def parrot_talk(incoming_message): bot_response = \"Hi, my name is Randy the Parrot, you said: \" + message return bot_response print(parrot_talk(\"hello!\")) Obviously that’s a simple example, let’s take it up a notch. responses = { \"Hello\": \"Hey! How can I help you?\", \"I need a refund\": \"I'm happy to help, can you give me more detail?\" } def respond(message): if message in responses: return responses[message] respond(\"I need a refund?\") Similar to what you saw the first time, here is a customer service chatbot. What we’re doing in the above dictionary is establishing keys that should relate to what our customers might say… those keys then map to an appropriate response. Now obviously the limitation here is that it would require the message to be exactly the same as the key in the dictionary. We can very quickly become far rigorous, using things like regular expressions on any given message, creating a flag to indicate the presence of various terms in the text & then keying off of that flag to populate our response. To take it even further, we could deploy ML algorithms that could predict whether or not a message falls under a given intent or topic which we could then map back to the dictionary of appropriate responses. Have you ever seen the auto responses in LinkedIn? You should try to have a conversation by just tapping those prompts… beyond being fun, it’s an interesting exploration in the sophistication as well as the lack thereof. Among the toughest things for chatbots is the ability to track the state of any given conversation, which will be very obvious once you go and have that chat in LinkedIn. Chatbots are surprisingly simple to create at first glance. Happy Data Science-ing!\n",

are getting undesired results or, the code is deployed in production and has started giving undesired results. How do you debug the code to identify and resolve the root cause? Logging is the process of recording the flow of code as it executes along with capturing any other events that occur during execution like Out Of Memory(OOM) issues or hard disk issues. Logging is usually done in files that can be retrieved later for analysis or troubleshooting. Using logs, we can capture the key information in the classes and function of our code. Log helps with What should you capture as part of the logs that will help to troubleshoot? Logs should be very detailed containing a descriptive message containing How to implement logging in Python? Python provides a library “logging” to write messages to a file or any other output stream like the standard output. Different levels of logging in the order of their severity A simple code to use logging and different severity options We log message structure is severity level like WARNING, followed by the default logging module root, followed by the message. We see that debug and info messages are not displayed. Logging module by default only displays messages with a severity level of warning and above What if you are debugging the code and want to show the messages for severity levels of Debug and Info? We use basicConfig() to set basic configuration for the logging system. basicConfig() will not take new settings into considerations if the root logger is already configured. I had to restart my kernel for the above code to work properly as the first time any of the logging function is called it configures the root logger internally. Common basicConfig() parameters filename: Specify the filename to which we want to write the log message filemode: Specify the mode in which the file needs to be opened like ‘w’ for write, ‘a’ for append. Default file mode is ‘a’ format: Specify the format string available as attributes in LogRecord datefmt: Specify the date format we want in the log messages. The format should be accepted by time.strftime() level: Severity level that you want to set for the root logger The following code snippet will demonstrate logging in classes and function. We create a TestLog class with the divide(); it takes two parameters and returns the division. In case there is an error in the division, we want to have the stack trace in the log file Creating an instance of the TestLog class and calling divide() For displaying a stack trace, we need to set exc_info as True in the except block of the Exception handling as done in the TestLog class Logging helps troubleshoot the application during development or after production deployment. Logging can be written in files or standard output using multiple formats, and we can also capture the stack trace. docs.python.org https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html\n",

very well with little effort, especially on heterogeneous data. A random forest is made up of an ensemble of decision trees. While each decision tree is easy to interpret — split order and threshold tell a lot about what the tree is prioritizing and how it's making decisions — the ensemble of trees is more of a black box. In a binary classification problem, a random forest classifier generally works better than a decision tree classifier. This can be explained by the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution B(n, p) is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success. Given a binomial distribution, we can easily find the probability of exactly k, 0≤k≤n, successes from the probability mass function. Define X as the random variable that follows B(n, p), then Pr(X = k) is given by: Where: Which is the probability of k successes with probability p, and n-k failures with probability 1-p, scaled up by all combinations of which successes and failures can be ordered. Then for any k and p: This equation means that the probability of success for more than half of the trials is greater than the probability of success for each individual trial. When translated to “forest language”, this is saying: assuming each tree in the forest is independent of one another and the probability of making the correct prediction from each tree is constant and greater than 50%, then the probability of more than half of the trees giving the correct predictions is greater than the probability of any individual tree making the correct prediction. A key assumption here is the independence between any two decision trees in the forest. In reality, when trees are trained using the same dataset, this assumption is improbable to be satisfied. Hence introducing randomness. The idea is that if we incorporate stochasticities into the build of each decision tree, they will be more independent of one another. Stochasticities are introduced by methods such as: Learning about these randomnesses will help us understand, or at least tame, the black box a little better. Sometimes when we replicate results, certain procedures might be overlooked because we assume they wouldn't affect the model's performance. Then we might be stuck at figuring out why our results didn't match expectations, and that is a really frustrating process because there are so many things that could potentially go wrong. The randomness I listed above is very well known in the random forest algorithm. Therefore, when someone writes a report about his/her model he/she would likely make sure readers don't get different results because of these randomnesses. To tackle each: So the above randomness can be avoided by simply disclosing all hyperparameters. However, there is another place where potential randomness may occur: whether we include a set of constant features. When I first started using the random forest algorithm, I completely overlooked the impact of constant features, and was very confused when including a set of constant features changed my model's performance. It shouldn't matter whether a set of constant features are included, right? Nodes cannot split on a constant feature because every data point takes the same value. As a result, constant features are never used as a splitting criterion in a decision tree. If we print out the feature_importances_, we will see that importance is always zero for any of these features. Nodes just examine them and discard them. The problem lies in how nodes deal with these features: examine, and then discard. Let's say max_features is set to five, when building tree T (a tree we randomly select to take a closer look at) in the forest: the root of T is going to select five features in a sequence predetermined by the total number of features and random_state. It will then pick the best one to split from, and split into two child nodes. This process repeats for each child node and eventually terminates if one of the limitations set by our hyperparameters is met, or if the node is pure (containing data from only one class). Let's say we train T with 100 non-constant features, and suppose the predetermined feature indices are [2, 99, 53, 15, 76] for the root node, [17, 22, 23, 81, 59] for its left child, and [47, 34, 65, 16, 67] for its right child. For simplicity of illustration, assume the usefulness of a feature increases as the index increases. Additionally, assume that max_depth is set to two. The set of three features T ends up splitting by is [99, 81, 67]. Now if we add 50 constant features, and assign them ids 100 to 149. Say the predetermined sequence with 150 total number of features is [104, 134, 85, 29, 3] for the root node, [0, 39,124, 91, 56] for its left child, and [94, 20, 100, 4, 80] for its right child. Since a splitter ignores a constant feature when it sees one, features with id ≥ 100 will not be picked even though they take up space as one of the five features a node can examine. The set of three features T ends up splitting by in this scenario is [85, 91, 94], which is different from the first scenario and is an overall more useful set. What happened to T generalizes to all trees in the forest, and will hence change the forest’s performance. Adding constant features affects feature usefulness in two ways: In conclusion, whether a set of constant features is included will affect a forest's performance. In a way, having a lot of constant features will add more randomness to the forest, because at each node, the max_features is effectively changing randomly. Beware of this effect next time you consider constant features as irrelevant.\n",

temporal-difference learning. As always I’ll link to the resources that taught and guided me at the bottom of the post. In my last two posts, we talked about dynamic programming (DP) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Temporal-difference (TD) learning is a kind of combination of the two ideas in several ways. Like MC, TD learns directly from experiencing episodes without needing a model of the environment. Like DP, TD learning can happen from incomplete episodes, utilizing a method called bootstrapping to estimate the remaining return for the episode. Basically put, it is making a guess of the value function, taking some steps, and then making another guess, updating our original guess towards this new one. where Gₜ is the return and α is a constant step-size parameter. We look at the error term between our estimated value and the return, and update our value function in the direction of that error. The simplest version of TD learning is TD(0) or one-step TD, which updates the value function towards the estimated return after one step. That estimate, like in the Bellman equation, consists of two parts: the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the next step. Now we can substitute this estimated return for our real return Gₜ, to come up with an estimated, biased algorithm. Let’s see how TD methods might prove advantageous over MC methods with an example. The idea of the example is making predictions on how long it will take to get home from work. Here is the sequence of states, times, and predictions. How can we update our value function based on this trajectory of experience? The following visualizations make the difference between MC and TD methods clear. On the left, we see the changes recommended by MC methods. Since we update each prediction based on the actual outcome, we have to wait until we get to the end and see that the total time took 43 minutes, and then go back to update each step towards that time. With TD learning, as seen on the right in the above diagrams, at every step, after taking a step, we can immediately update the previous step. A major advantage of TD learning is that it learns even without knowing the final outcome. After all, it is entirely possible for an agent to receive incomplete sequences, or even work in continuing environments that don’t actually have a final outcome. By substituting TD in for MC in our control loop, we get one of the best known algorithms in reinforcement learning. The idea is called Sarsa. We start with our Q-values, and move our Q-value slightly towards our TD target, which is the reward plus our discounted Q-value of the next state minus the Q-value of where we started. Sarsa uses every element of the quintuple of events that describes the transition from one state-action pair to the next. Starting to get an inkling of where it got its name from? Let’s take a look at the pseudocode of the Sarsa Algorithm for On-Policy TD Control: To bring this to life, we’ll take a look at an example that may seem familiar, Windy Gridworld. Windy Gridworld is the same as the gridworld we came to know and love in previous posts, but with a twist: there is a crosswind running up the middle of the grid! The strength of the wind varies column by column, represented by the numbers underneath each column. The strength indicates the numbers of cells shifted upwards after taking an action. For example, if in the cell directly to the right of the goal, taking the action of moving left will put you in the space directly above the goal. An important thing to note is the fact that Monte Carlo methods may not work here, as a policy may be found that causes the agent to stay in the same space, effectively making the next episode never-ending. Using Sarsa allows us to learn within the episode that such a policy is poor, and will try something else. Next time, I will be diving into Q-learning for off-policy TD control, where we will be approximating the optimal state-value function independently of the policy followed, similarly to how is done in off-policy MC methods. Thanks very much for reading, I look forward to learning more in this fascinating sub-realm of machine learning.

       "      <td>John Wittenauer Nov 25, 2014·6 min read This content originally appeared on Curious Insight A little while ago I participated in a competition on Kaggle called the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge, and I wanted to share some thoughts about my approach to the competition and some of the lessons I learned that may be useful to other machine learning practitioners. If you’re not familiar with Kaggle, it’s the self-described “Home of Data Science”. Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions put together by various companies and organizations. The competitions are typically well defined and time-bound, and usually offer some monetary award for the winning entries in the competition. Individuals and teams from all over the world can sign up and compete, submitting their best results to a public leaderboard to see where they stand. At the end of the competition, a different draw from the test data is used to evaluate each competitor’s best models, and the final “private” leaderboard that results from evaluating those models on the test data is used to determine your rank in the competition. The competition that I took part in was the largest that Kaggle has ever hosted, with nearly 1,800 teams participating. The event was sponsored by CERN with backing from Google and several other organizations. Our task was to analyze a set of simulated particle collision data containing features characterizing events detected by ATLAS (a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN). The objective of the analysis was to classify events as either a signal, indicating the tau tau Decay of a Higgs boson, or background noise. It sounds complicated, but in truth there is very little physics knowledge required (although it certainly helps when deriving interesting features from the data). Since this was my first exposure to Kaggle, I pretty much had to learn as I went along. Now that I’ve done it once, I feel confident that I would be even more successful with less ramp-up time in future competitions. Here are the most useful insights that I gained during this process. It goes without saying that in order to be sucessful in a Kaggle competition, you need to have a fair amount of data science and machine learning knowledge already. But another skill set you’ll probably need that may not be quite as obvious is the ability to program. While I’m sure that some competitors make due with software packages like RapidMiner or KNIME, the impression I got from reading the forums and listening to other participants is that almost everyone is using either R or python along with each language’s vast array of open-source software (I personally used python). There are a number of challenges such as generating submission files or implementing custom evaluation metrics that are simply easier to do in code, not to mention things like the transparency and reproducability of your solution. One aspect of the competition that I underestimated initially was just setting up a pipeline to be able to generate a valid submission file. Each competition has its own format and specifics in terms of what a “solution” looks like, and you need to get it right in order to even see what your score is. It’s a pretty good idea to get this set up right at the start and submit a solution with just random guessing, so you can verify that it works. In fact, you can extend this methodology to other aspects of the “machine learning pipleine”, which leads to… Coming from a software engineering background, I seemed to have a stronger tendency to write “good” code than some of the other competitors, and while it requires more thought and effort early on, I think this pays off in the long run. In particular, I focused on modularizing and parameterizing various stages of the pipline such as data loading, data visualization, feature scaling &amp; imputation, model training, cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, and submission file generation. Using this approach, I was able to run lots of different experiments very quickly with little effort. Check out the “higgs” folder of my GitHub repo for Kaggle competitions to see a concrete example (this is a relatively simple pipeline but it gets the point across). Once of the tendencies that machine learning newcomers seem to have is to just load up their favorite ML library and start throwing algorithms at the data to see what sticks (I admit that I’m guilty of this myself!). In order to understand the characteristics of the data you’re working with, it’s important to do some exploratory analysis before jumping to the modeling stage. This can lead to valuable insights that may affect modeling decisions, for example detecting the presence of outliers that need to be dealt with. A few things I like to try are calculating basic stats on each feature (mean, median, standard deviation etc.), computing histograms or kernel density functions for each of the features, generating a correlation matrix for the data set, and experimenting with transforms like PCA or even some manifold learning algorithms like Isomap. It’s generally a good idea to see how far you can get with simpler models like linear regression, logistic regression, or Naive Bayes, before trying to build more complex models. One advantage that simple models have is they usually train really fast, so you can run lot of experiments quickly. They also tend to be more interpretable than complex non-linear models, so attempting to optimize a linear model may lead to valuable insights that you can leverage with more complex models if needed. This sentiment was re-iterated over and over again by many of the experts in the competition. Often the difference between good models and great models is the choice of features used. There’s no hard and fast rule for deriving features, it’s very much a creative process. Curiousity and persistence are critical. Another common thread that was very evident from the post-competition forum discussion is how important it is to basically ignore the public leaderboard scores and trust that your cross-validation scores are a good indication of the model’s ability to generalize on unseen data. There were a number of teams that overfit to the public leaderboard in the Higgs competition by making hundreds of submissions and basically tuning their model parameters to optimize their leaderboard score. This technique gives the illusion of progress throughout the competition as it appears that your score is increasing, but the final evaluation uses a different subset of the test data than the public leaderboard and it’s clear which teams overfit because their private scores are much lower than their public scores. Finally, one technique that I didn’t use that was very popular among the top competitors is creating an ensemble of many models together for the final submission. Ensembles have been shown to generalize better on average than any single model, so this is almost a no-brainer. There are a number of different ensembling techniques and most of the top libraries implement at least a few ensemble algorithms. One caveat with ensembles though is to wait until you’ve optimized a single model as much as possible before trying to ensemble since it’s very computationally expensive and time-consuming to train a large ensemble. Hopefully you found this advice useful and will be able to apply it to future machine learning projects and Kaggle competitions.

In this post I will focus on a particular flavor of data scientist. I will talk about the qualities needed to be a good data scientist-engineer who ships relevance products to users. Some examples of relevance products are: These folks need to be strong at data science and engineering to be successful. Some places call these folks as Machine Learning engineers since most of the work they do involves Machine Learning. More generally, I feel relevance engineer is a good term to describe them. Relevance engineers have a common set of skills that they draw upon to get their jobs done. The list below doesn’t include some of the known, obvious skills. You obviously need to be smart. You obviously need to have (or be able to learn quickly) the required “book” knowledge. But beyond that, there are a bunch of not-so-obvious skills that you can’t learn from a book. Here are some of those, in no particular order: This list is by no means exhaustive, but does capture some of the qualities of the smartest folks I have worked with. Happy to hear what you think.

It is always fun to find one that makes you scratch your head. Usually, when you see an ineffective data visualization, there is a marketing message [look how cool this is! Alternatively, even you can do this!] not far behind. Authors use data visualizations to answer an implied question or at least clarify a point. For instance, a manager might want to convince his boss that more support staff is needed and prepare a line chart showing the ticket arrival trend. In essence, the chart answers the question “Are more trouble tickets being opened?” or “What is the trouble ticket trend?” or even “How many trouble tickets were opened last week?” I want you to study the following data visualization for a moment and ask yourself, “What question does this data viz answer?” or “What point does it clarify?” At first, I thought the question was “What is the ticket arrival rate” or “Which day is the busiest?” These would be logical questions for a manager trying to plan the staffing hours for a Support department. The chart appears to be time-series related with weekday as the time and sort of indicated by the title Number of ticket raised in the last week, per day by the department. So a quick analysis would be “The first of the week is rough, then it heats up again at the end of the week.” However, if you examine the x-axis, you might notice that the days are not in sequential order (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday). Then I thought, “Oh they must be ranking the days by arrival”. However, Friday is listed first and it was not the day with the most traffic. If the days were ranked, then Monday would be the first day. I cannot tell from this chart what the second biggest day is without more study. Maybe the chart meant to emphasize the department, perhaps the question was “Who opened the most tickets last week?” This would help the manager understand if one department needed additional staffing. It’s relatively easy to see that Support (blue line) opened the most tickets, but which department was second? If you had to rank them, in what order do they belong? Just like with figuring out the ranking of the days, you have to start counting in your head. If you are the manager reviewing this chart — it costs you time. How would you grade this chart on “efficient communication” when the manager needs a calculator or notepad to figure out what happened? Have you determined what is wrong with the axis yet? The creator used the defaults and the software placed weekdays in alphabetical instead of sequential order. This is an example of what can happen when you let the software do the work for you. Is it possible that this humble data visualization is trying to communicate too much information at once? Moreover, it ends up doing nothing but creating confusion. There are two questions: What is the daily arrival rate and Which department opened the most tickets? I think it’s confusing to have it in one chart — you spend too much time trying to figure out the information. There are 2 questions: What is the daily arrival rate and Which department opened the most tickets? Here’s my suggested makeover using SAS Visual Analytics and some interactive reporting. Let’s put the data in one panel but use separate charts. In this example, the top chart shows the overall arrival rate for the week and the bottom charts provide details on who opened the tickets and the main issues. If the manager wants to see the week before, she can select it from the drop-down. Also, I added a reference line that contains the average tickets opened per week as an example. You need a baseline to know if you are getting more or fewer tickets than you usually receive. Probably a line that showed the average per day would be more useful since there is variation. What I like about SAS Visual Analytics is adding the interactivity. When you look at this data, it’s noticeable that Monday had the highest tickets. The manager can click on the point, and the report instantly filters to show the department with the most tickets that day and their associated issues. Support opened the most tickets and in general MS Office was the main issue. For more details, the manager can click the department name to determine the issues. By hovering slightly, you can see there were 92 issues opened by Billing that day. Moreover, when you click the bar, the issues chart updates to show the main issues. Nice. I would probably add a link to the Issues that allowed the manager to see a list of the open ticket or maybe their current status. Also, I would want a tab that showed the fix response time, overdue tickets, and other similar metrics. Even without the interactivity, when I split the chart into two charts, it made it easier to understand the information at a glance. The interactivity made the data easier to understand and answer questions on the spot. Plus the manager could use a tablet to review this information while waiting for a meeting to start. What do you think? What might you have added or taken away? Originally published at bi-notes.com on October 10, 2013.

It’s what gives you that euphoric feeling of accomplishment when you’re finished. But just as mountain climbers have to descend, model builders have to deploy. You have to put your model in a form that will be usable (and palatable) to users. Sometimes things don’t work out the way you hoped. I had a client, a very skilled engineer, who wanted a model to predict how many workers he would need to hire during the year. His organization produced three lines of products, most of which were customized for individual customers. A few years earlier, he had gone to great effort and expense to develop a model to predict his manpower needs. He collected data on how many of each type of product he had produced over the past five years and from that data had his managers estimate how long it took to make each product and complete the most common customizations. Then he had his sales force estimated the number of orders they expected the following year. He reasoned that adding up the time it took to produce a product multiplied by the number of expected orders would give him the number of manhours he would need. It was a classic bottom-up modeling approach. The model had a problem, though. It didn’t work. Even after tinkering with the manufacturing times and correcting for employee leave, administrative functions, and inefficiency, the model still wasn’t very accurate. Moreover, it took his administrative assistant several weeks each year to collect the projected sales data to input into the model. Some of the sales force estimated more sales than they expected to try to impress the boss. Others estimated fewer sales so that they would have a better chance of making whatever goal might be given to them. A few avoided giving the administrative assistant any forecasts at all, so she just used numbers from the previous year. Using a statistical modeling approach, I found that his historical staffing was highly correlated to just one factor — the number of units of one of the products he produced in the prior year. It made sense to me. His historical staffing levels were appropriate because he had hired staff as he needed them, albeit somewhat after his backlog reached a crisis. His business had also been growing at a fairly steady rate. So long as conditions in his market did not change, predicting future staffing needs was straightforward. He didn’t need to rely on projections from his psychologically-fragile sales force. But my model proved to be quite unsettling to many. The manager of the product line that was used as the basis of the model claimed the model proved his division merited a greater share of the organization’s resources, and bigger bonuses for him and his staff. Managers of the two product lines that were not included in the model claimed the model was too simplistic because it ignored their contributions. At that point, the client had a complex model that he liked but didn’t work and a simple model that worked but nobody liked. He probably would have continued to use the complex model if it didn’t take so much work to gather the input data. Valid or not, the simple model had no credibility with his managers. He could calculate a forecast with the model but was reluctant to favor the model over the intuitions of the managers. So given his two flawed alternatives, the client decided to move manpower forecasting to the back burner until the next crisis would again bring it to a boil. I wish I could say that this was an isolated case, but it’s more of a rule than an exception especially with technically-oriented clients who are most comfortable working from the bottom details up to the prediction. Domain expertise is necessary to any modeling effort. It’s needed to guide the selection of model inputs and outputs. But it shouldn’t dictate how a model is developed. That is the realm of the model-builder. I once developed a model for a client to predict the relative risks associated with real estate that they managed. The managers wanted a quick-and-dirty way to set priorities for conducting more thorough risk-evaluations of the properties. I based my model on information that would be readily-available to the client. They could evaluate a property for a few hundred dollars and decide in a day or two whether further evaluation was needed immediately or whether it could be deferred. When the model-development project was done, the model was turned over to the operations group for implementation. The first thing the operations manager did was invite experts he worked with to refine the model. Very quickly, the refinements became expansions. The model went from quick-and-dirty to comprehensive-and-protracted. It took the operations group on average of $50,000 (this was in 1980, so it would be about $168,000 today) over six-months to evaluate each property. The priorities set by the refined model were virtually identical to the priorities set by the quick-and-dirty model. Was one of these models good and the other bad? Not exactly. There’s an important distinction to be made. Scientists, engineers, and many other professionals are taught that, all else being equal, simple is best. It’s Ockham’s razor. A simple model that predicts the same answers as a more-complicated model should be considered to be better. It’s more efficient. But sometimes, you as the modeler, have to be more flexible. The operations manager wasn’t comfortable with a simple model. He needed to be confident in the results, which, for him, required adding every theoretical possibility his experts could think of. He didn’t want to ignore any sources of risk, even if they were rare or unlikely. That made for a very inefficient model, but if you don’t have confidence in a model and don’t use it, it’s not the tool you need. Here’s a side note. The project described was one of the first big modeling efforts I ran at the beginning of my career. Almost forty years later, the exact same thing happened in the last big modeling effort I ran in my career. In 1980, I went apoplectic. The client changed the rules. What was he doing? Yes, I was young and stupid. In 2019, I managed to stay with the model (which I couldn’t in 1980). I walked the client through every change he and his committee of experts thought would help (I had an all-possible-regressions software option that I didn’t have in 1980), and showed him how the changes actually made the model performance worse. Of course, he won in the end. He knew I was about to retire, so he waited me out. That’s fine, he’s the one who needs to live with it. I only need to write about it. These cases illustrate how there’s more to modeling than just the technical details. There are also artistic and psychological aspects to be mastered. Textbooks describe methods to find the best model components but not necessarily the ones that will work for the model’s users. Sometimes you have to be flexible. Think of Ockham’s Razor as more of a spatula than a cleaver. Models are like sausages— they look good on the outside but you don’t know what might be on the inside. Like sausages, models need to look good on the outside especially if there are things on the inside that might make most users choke. You have to package the model. First, it can’t look so intimidating that users break out in a sweat when they see it. Leave the equations to the technical reviewers; hide them from the naive users. USDA inspectors have to look inside sausages, but you don’t. Second, put the model in a form that can be used easily. That inch-thick report may be great documentation, but it’ll garner more dust than users. If your users are familiar with Excel, program the model as a spreadsheet. If you know a computer language, put the model in a standalone application. A model is only as successful as the use to which it is put.

It’s just a way to make your model fit nicely. There must be fifty ways to fix your data. She said it’s really not my preference to transform. ’Cause sometimes, the new scales confuse, overfit, or misinform. But I’ll Box-Cox ’em all if it means they’ll fit the norm. There must be fifty ways to fix your data. Fifty ways to fix your data. Take the tails for a trim, Kim. Try a replace, Grace. You can use the rank, Hank. Just try ’em and see. Make it more smooth, Suz. Lots of functions you can choose. A higher degree, Dee. Will get you more fee. Sing to the tune of “Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover” by Paul Simon. In exploring a dataset, you need to be sure that you have the right numbers and that those numbers are right. You need to find and fix problems with individual data points like errors and outliers. You need to find and fix problems with observations like censored data and replicates. And you need to find and fix problems with variables like their frequency distributions and their correlations with other variables. Often, rehabilitating variables involves transformations, methods of changing the scales of your variables that might further your analyses. As part of this process, you should consider what other information you can add that might be relevant to your analysis. This is especially important if you are planning to develop an exploratory model. Experience will tell you when expanding your dataset might make a difference and when it won’t. If you don’t have that experience yet, start by learning about why you might transform variables and how it can be done. Then practice; try a variety of different techniques and learn along the way. But first you need to understand some of the pros and cons of what you might do to your dataset. There is some controversy over the use of transformations (and other methods of creating new variables) that has caused a few statisticians to argue forcefully either for or against their use. The three most common arguments that have been made against the use of transformations involve: There is a single simple argument for the use of transformations — they work better than the original variable scales. If they don’t work better, you don’t use them. William of Ockham would have liked that argument. Think of pH. It’s really the negative log of the hydrogen-ion concentration. Standard deviation is just a square-root transformation of variance. So what constitutes working better? Consider these examples of the three ways that transformations are used. One, perhaps the most important use of transformations is to reduce the effects of violations of statistical assumptions. If you plan to do any statistical analysis that involves using a Normal (or other) distribution as a model of your dependent variable, it’s important to use a scale that makes the data fit the distribution as closely as possible. If the data aren’t a good fit for the distribution, probabilities calculated for some tests and statistics will be in error. Because costly or risky decisions may be made from these probabilities, inaccuracies can be a big deal. So using a transformation to correct violations of statistical assumptions is a very important use. Two, perhaps the most common use of transformations is to find scales that optimize the linear correlation between data for a dependent variable and data for independent variables. Model building almost always benefits from this use of transformations. Everybody does it. Three, perhaps the most overlooked use of transformations is, in a word, convenience. Sometimes transformations are used to convert measured data to more familiar units, improve computational efficiency, eliminate replicates, reduce the number of variables, and other actions that facilitate, but not necessarily improve, the analysis. Now that you’ve been warned, here are four things you can do that might further your analyses: There is nothing sacred about this classification. Some of the categories might overlap or omit other ideas, so use these examples to stimulate your own thinking. In time, you’ll develop a sense of what you need for a particular analysis. Sample adjustments involve changing individual data points for a variable. Unlike most transformations which result in the creation of a new variable, sample adjustments leave the original variable intact. You use adjustments to correct errors, fill in missing data, reveal censored data, rein in unrepresentative replicates, and accommodate outliers. Using sample adjustments is a good place to start enhancing your data set. They are like digging out weeds and filling in holes before you plant a new lawn. It wouldn’t make sense to do it later, or worse, not at all. After you’ve filled all the holes in your data matrix with sample adjustments, the next thing you should do is to make sure the dependent variable approximates a Normal (or other appropriate) distribution. If you haven’t looked at histograms and other indicators of Normality, always do that first. Then, if your data distribution differs enough from the Normal distribution to make you nervous about your analysis, try a transformation of the dependent variable. Try several, in fact. Transformations of dependent variables create new variables but you’ll keep only one of the candidate dependent variables for an analysis. You’ll want to pick the candidate dependent variable that fits a theoretical distribution best so that calculations of test probabilities are most accurate. If the frequency distribution of your dependent variable is skewed toward higher values, try a root transformation. If the frequency distribution is skewed toward lower values, try a power transformation. Better yet, try a Box-Cox transformation. Box-Cox transformations include the most commonly used transformations — roots, powers, reciprocals, and logs — as well as an infinite number of minor variations in between. The only downside is that the process is labor intensive if you don’t have software that performs the analysis. If the goal of your analysis is prediction, transforming your dependent variable can be problematical. Predictions would be of the transformed variable which may not have an easily understandable scale. If that is the case, you would have to back-transform the prediction to the original understandable scale. This can become mathematically complex if tou used a Box-Cox transformation or if you plan to calculate confidence intervals. Once you have the dependent variable you want to work with, you can go on to examine all the relationships between that dependent variable and the independent variables. While the target for transforming a dependent variable is the Normal frequency distribution, the target for transforming independent variables is a straight-line correlation between the dependent variable and each independent variable. This can be a lot of work. Remember, you have to look at correlations and plots, perhaps even for special groupings of the data. That’s the reason you always start by finding a scale for the dependent variable that fits a Normal distribution. You wouldn’t want to repeat this process for more than one dependent variable if you didn’t have to. Variable adjustments are changes, some quite minor, made to all the values for a variable (as opposed to just modifying specific data points as in sample adjustments). All variable adjustments create new independent variables for analysis. Examples of variable adjustments include: Sometimes it can be useful to change the scale or units of a variable to simplify or facilitate an analysis, by: Changing the scale of a variable is different from changing the units of a variable. Both are important. Changing units usually involves only simple mathematical calculations with or without the addition or deletion of information. Rescaling variables involves adding or removing information or changing a point-of-reference. Rescaling usually involves making changes based on logic but may include mathematical considerations as well. Recoding is perhaps the most common way of rescaling a variable. Some statistical software have utilities to facilitate recoding. Improving the correlation between a dependent variable and an independent variable is a big part of modeling. The objectives of this type of transformation are (1) to persuade the data to follow a straight line, and (2) minimize the scatter of the data around the line. Here are a few examples of mathematical functions used as transformations. Variable combinations are new variables created from two or more existing variables using simple arithmetic operations (sums, differences, products, and ratios) or more complex mathematical functions. Variable combinations should be based on theory rather than created for convenience. Usually the variables combined should have the same units (e.g., dollars), although units can be standardized using z-scores. You won’t necessarily just add variables at the beginning of your analysis. You may add them continuously throughout your analysis as you learn more about your data. Some variables may turn out to be critical to the analysis and others will just facilitate reporting or some other ancillary function. Supplemental variables can be created by concatenating or partitioning existing variables, or by adding new information from metadata or external references (e.g., federal census data). When your instructor gave you a dataset in Statistics 101, that was it. You did what the assignment called for, got the desired answer, and you were finished. But it doesn’t work that way in the real world overflowing with data but lacking in wisdom. You have to put more effort into making sense of things. Statistics is the mortar that brings data and metadata together to make building blocks of information into a temple of wisdom. Transformations are like mason’s tools. They can smooth, reshape, adjust, add texture, augment, condense, and on and on. Suffice it to say that with transformations, there must be at least fifty ways to fix your data.

If you’re not familiar with Kaggle, it’s the self-described “Home of Data Science”. Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions put together by various companies and organizations. The competitions are typically well defined and time-bound, and usually offer some monetary award for the winning entries in the competition. Individuals and teams from all over the world can sign up and compete, submitting their best results to a public leaderboard to see where they stand. At the end of the competition, a different draw from the test data is used to evaluate each competitor’s best models, and the final “private” leaderboard that results from evaluating those models on the test data is used to determine your rank in the competition. The competition that I took part in was the largest that Kaggle has ever hosted, with nearly 1,800 teams participating. The event was sponsored by CERN with backing from Google and several other organizations. Our task was to analyze a set of simulated particle collision data containing features characterizing events detected by ATLAS (a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN). The objective of the analysis was to classify events as either a signal, indicating the tau tau Decay of a Higgs boson, or background noise. It sounds complicated, but in truth there is very little physics knowledge required (although it certainly helps when deriving interesting features from the data). Since this was my first exposure to Kaggle, I pretty much had to learn as I went along. Now that I’ve done it once, I feel confident that I would be even more successful with less ramp-up time in future competitions. Here are the most useful insights that I gained during this process. It goes without saying that in order to be sucessful in a Kaggle competition, you need to have a fair amount of data science and machine learning knowledge already. But another skill set you’ll probably need that may not be quite as obvious is the ability to program. While I’m sure that some competitors make due with software packages like RapidMiner or KNIME, the impression I got from reading the forums and listening to other participants is that almost everyone is using either R or python along with each language’s vast array of open-source software (I personally used python). There are a number of challenges such as generating submission files or implementing custom evaluation metrics that are simply easier to do in code, not to mention things like the transparency and reproducability of your solution. One aspect of the competition that I underestimated initially was just setting up a pipeline to be able to generate a valid submission file. Each competition has its own format and specifics in terms of what a “solution” looks like, and you need to get it right in order to even see what your score is. It’s a pretty good idea to get this set up right at the start and submit a solution with just random guessing, so you can verify that it works. In fact, you can extend this methodology to other aspects of the “machine learning pipleine”, which leads to… Coming from a software engineering background, I seemed to have a stronger tendency to write “good” code than some of the other competitors, and while it requires more thought and effort early on, I think this pays off in the long run. In particular, I focused on modularizing and parameterizing various stages of the pipline such as data loading, data visualization, feature scaling & imputation, model training, cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, and submission file generation. Using this approach, I was able to run lots of different experiments very quickly with little effort. Check out the “higgs” folder of my GitHub repo for Kaggle competitions to see a concrete example (this is a relatively simple pipeline but it gets the point across). Once of the tendencies that machine learning newcomers seem to have is to just load up their favorite ML library and start throwing algorithms at the data to see what sticks (I admit that I’m guilty of this myself!). In order to understand the characteristics of the data you’re working with, it’s important to do some exploratory analysis before jumping to the modeling stage. This can lead to valuable insights that may affect modeling decisions, for example detecting the presence of outliers that need to be dealt with. A few things I like to try are calculating basic stats on each feature (mean, median, standard deviation etc.), computing histograms or kernel density functions for each of the features, generating a correlation matrix for the data set, and experimenting with transforms like PCA or even some manifold learning algorithms like Isomap. It’s generally a good idea to see how far you can get with simpler models like linear regression, logistic regression, or Naive Bayes, before trying to build more complex models. One advantage that simple models have is they usually train really fast, so you can run lot of experiments quickly. They also tend to be more interpretable than complex non-linear models, so attempting to optimize a linear model may lead to valuable insights that you can leverage with more complex models if needed. This sentiment was re-iterated over and over again by many of the experts in the competition. Often the difference between good models and great models is the choice of features used. There’s no hard and fast rule for deriving features, it’s very much a creative process. Curiousity and persistence are critical. Another common thread that was very evident from the post-competition forum discussion is how important it is to basically ignore the public leaderboard scores and trust that your cross-validation scores are a good indication of the model’s ability to generalize on unseen data. There were a number of teams that overfit to the public leaderboard in the Higgs competition by making hundreds of submissions and basically tuning their model parameters to optimize their leaderboard score. This technique gives the illusion of progress throughout the competition as it appears that your score is increasing, but the final evaluation uses a different subset of the test data than the public leaderboard and it’s clear which teams overfit because their private scores are much lower than their public scores. Finally, one technique that I didn’t use that was very popular among the top competitors is creating an ensemble of many models together for the final submission. Ensembles have been shown to generalize better on average than any single model, so this is almost a no-brainer. There are a number of different ensembling techniques and most of the top libraries implement at least a few ensemble algorithms. One caveat with ensembles though is to wait until you’ve optimized a single model as much as possible before trying to ensemble since it’s very computationally expensive and time-consuming to train a large ensemble. Hopefully you found this advice useful and will be able to apply it to future machine learning projects and Kaggle competitions.

used lately to describe a wide variety of skills & roles. In this post I will focus on a particular flavor of data scientist. I will talk about the qualities needed to be a good data scientist-engineer who ships relevance products to users. Some examples of relevance products are: These folks need to be strong at data science and engineering to be successful. Some places call these folks as Machine Learning engineers since most of the work they do involves Machine Learning. More generally, I feel relevance engineer is a good term to describe them. Relevance engineers have a common set of skills that they draw upon to get their jobs done. The list below doesn’t include some of the known, obvious skills. You obviously need to be smart. You obviously need to have (or be able to learn quickly) the required “book” knowledge. But beyond that, there are a bunch of not-so-obvious skills that you can’t learn from a book. Here are some of those, in no particular order: This list is by no means exhaustive, but does capture some of the qualities of the smartest folks I have worked with. Happy to hear what you think. Thanks to Peter Bailey and Andrew Hogue for feedback on the initial revisions. *In this post, feature means a software feature, not a machine learning feature.  \n",

common characteristics, which is to communicate a message clearly and quickly. It is always fun to find one that makes you scratch your head. Usually, when you see an ineffective data visualization, there is a marketing message [look how cool this is! Alternatively, even you can do this!] not far behind. Authors use data visualizations to answer an implied question or at least clarify a point. For instance, a manager might want to convince his boss that more support staff is needed and prepare a line chart showing the ticket arrival trend. In essence, the chart answers the question “Are more trouble tickets being opened?” or “What is the trouble ticket trend?” or even “How many trouble tickets were opened last week?” I want you to study the following data visualization for a moment and ask yourself, “What question does this data viz answer?” or “What point does it clarify?” At first, I thought the question was “What is the ticket arrival rate” or “Which day is the busiest?” These would be logical questions for a manager trying to plan the staffing hours for a Support department. The chart appears to be time-series related with weekday as the time and sort of indicated by the title Number of ticket raised in the last week, per day by the department. So a quick analysis would be “The first of the week is rough, then it heats up again at the end of the week.” However, if you examine the x-axis, you might notice that the days are not in sequential order (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday). Then I thought, “Oh they must be ranking the days by arrival”. However, Friday is listed first and it was not the day with the most traffic. If the days were ranked, then Monday would be the first day. I cannot tell from this chart what the second biggest day is without more study. Maybe the chart meant to emphasize the department, perhaps the question was “Who opened the most tickets last week?” This would help the manager understand if one department needed additional staffing. It’s relatively easy to see that Support (blue line) opened the most tickets, but which department was second? If you had to rank them, in what order do they belong? Just like with figuring out the ranking of the days, you have to start counting in your head. If you are the manager reviewing this chart — it costs you time. How would you grade this chart on “efficient communication” when the manager needs a calculator or notepad to figure out what happened? Have you determined what is wrong with the axis yet? The creator used the defaults and the software placed weekdays in alphabetical instead of sequential order. This is an example of what can happen when you let the software do the work for you. Is it possible that this humble data visualization is trying to communicate too much information at once? Moreover, it ends up doing nothing but creating confusion. There are two questions: What is the daily arrival rate and Which department opened the most tickets? I think it’s confusing to have it in one chart — you spend too much time trying to figure out the information. There are 2 questions: What is the daily arrival rate and Which department opened the most tickets? Here’s my suggested makeover using SAS Visual Analytics and some interactive reporting. Let’s put the data in one panel but use separate charts. In this example, the top chart shows the overall arrival rate for the week and the bottom charts provide details on who opened the tickets and the main issues. If the manager wants to see the week before, she can select it from the drop-down. Also, I added a reference line that contains the average tickets opened per week as an example. You need a baseline to know if you are getting more or fewer tickets than you usually receive. Probably a line that showed the average per day would be more useful since there is variation. What I like about SAS Visual Analytics is adding the interactivity. When you look at this data, it’s noticeable that Monday had the highest tickets. The manager can click on the point, and the report instantly filters to show the department with the most tickets that day and their associated issues. Support opened the most tickets and in general MS Office was the main issue. For more details, the manager can click the department name to determine the issues. By hovering slightly, you can see there were 92 issues opened by Billing that day. Moreover, when you click the bar, the issues chart updates to show the main issues. Nice. I would probably add a link to the Issues that allowed the manager to see a list of the open ticket or maybe their current status. Also, I would want a tab that showed the fix response time, overdue tickets, and other similar metrics. Even without the interactivity, when I split the chart into two charts, it made it easier to understand the information at a glance. The interactivity made the data easier to understand and answer questions on the spot. Plus the manager could use a tablet to review this information while waiting for a meeting to start.

It’s what you spend so much time planning for. It’s what everybody wants to talk about. It’s what gives you that euphoric feeling of accomplishment when you’re finished. But just as mountain climbers have to descend, model builders have to deploy. You have to put your model in a form that will be usable (and palatable) to users. Sometimes things don’t work out the way you hoped. I had a client, a very skilled engineer, who wanted a model to predict how many workers he would need to hire during the year. His organization produced three lines of products, most of which were customized for individual customers. A few years earlier, he had gone to great effort and expense to develop a model to predict his manpower needs. He collected data on how many of each type of product he had produced over the past five years and from that data had his managers estimate how long it took to make each product and complete the most common customizations. Then he had his sales force estimated the number of orders they expected the following year. He reasoned that adding up the time it took to produce a product multiplied by the number of expected orders would give him the number of manhours he would need. It was a classic bottom-up modeling approach. The model had a problem, though. It didn’t work. Even after tinkering with the manufacturing times and correcting for employee leave, administrative functions, and inefficiency, the model still wasn’t very accurate. Moreover, it took his administrative assistant several weeks each year to collect the projected sales data to input into the model. Some of the sales force estimated more sales than they expected to try to impress the boss. Others estimated fewer sales so that they would have a better chance of making whatever goal might be given to them. A few avoided giving the administrative assistant any forecasts at all, so she just used numbers from the previous year. Using a statistical modeling approach, I found that his historical staffing was highly correlated to just one factor — the number of units of one of the products he produced in the prior year. It made sense to me. His historical staffing levels were appropriate because he had hired staff as he needed them, albeit somewhat after his backlog reached a crisis. His business had also been growing at a fairly steady rate. So long as conditions in his market did not change, predicting future staffing needs was straightforward. He didn’t need to rely on projections from his psychologically-fragile sales force. But my model proved to be quite unsettling to many. The manager of the product line that was used as the basis of the model claimed the model proved his division merited a greater share of the organization’s resources, and bigger bonuses for him and his staff. Managers of the two product lines that were not included in the model claimed the model was too simplistic because it ignored their contributions. At that point, the client had a complex model that he liked but didn’t work and a simple model that worked but nobody liked. He probably would have continued to use the complex model if it didn’t take so much work to gather the input data. Valid or not, the simple model had no credibility with his managers. He could calculate a forecast with the model but was reluctant to favor the model over the intuitions of the managers. So given his two flawed alternatives, the client decided to move manpower forecasting to the back burner until the next crisis would again bring it to a boil. I wish I could say that this was an isolated case, but it’s more of a rule than an exception especially with technically-oriented clients who are most comfortable working from the bottom details up to the prediction. Domain expertise is necessary to any modeling effort. It’s needed to guide the selection of model inputs and outputs. But it shouldn’t dictate how a model is developed. That is the realm of the model-builder. I once developed a model for a client to predict the relative risks associated with real estate that they managed. The managers wanted a quick-and-dirty way to set priorities for conducting more thorough risk-evaluations of the properties. I based my model on information that would be readily-available to the client. They could evaluate a property for a few hundred dollars and decide in a day or two whether further evaluation was needed immediately or whether it could be deferred. When the model-development project was done, the model was turned over to the operations group for implementation. The first thing the operations manager did was invite experts he worked with to refine the model. Very quickly, the refinements became expansions. The model went from quick-and-dirty to comprehensive-and-protracted. It took the operations group on average of $50,000 (this was in 1980, so it would be about $168,000 today) over six-months to evaluate each property. The priorities set by the refined model were virtually identical to the priorities set by the quick-and-dirty model. Was one of these models good and the other bad? Not exactly. There’s an important distinction to be made. Scientists, engineers, and many other professionals are taught that, all else being equal, simple is best. It’s Ockham’s razor. A simple model that predicts the same answers as a more-complicated model should be considered to be better. It’s more efficient. But sometimes, you as the modeler, have to be more flexible. The operations manager wasn’t comfortable with a simple model. He needed to be confident in the results, which, for him, required adding every theoretical possibility his experts could think of. He didn’t want to ignore any sources of risk, even if they were rare or unlikely. That made for a very inefficient model, but if you don’t have confidence in a model and don’t use it, it’s not the tool you need. Here’s a side note. The project described was one of the first big modeling efforts I ran at the beginning of my career. Almost forty years later, the exact same thing happened in the last big modeling effort I ran in my career. In 1980, I went apoplectic. The client changed the rules. What was he doing? Yes, I was young and stupid. In 2019, I managed to stay with the model (which I couldn’t in 1980). I walked the client through every change he and his committee of experts thought would help (I had an all-possible-regressions software option that I didn’t have in 1980), and showed him how the changes actually made the model performance worse. Of course, he won in the end. He knew I was about to retire, so he waited me out. That’s fine, he’s the one who needs to live with it. I only need to write about it. These cases illustrate how there’s more to modeling than just the technical details. There are also artistic and psychological aspects to be mastered. Textbooks describe methods to find the best model components but not necessarily the ones that will work for the model’s users. Sometimes you have to be flexible. Think of Ockham’s Razor as more of a spatula than a cleaver. Models are like sausages— they look good on the outside but you don’t know what might be on the inside. Like sausages, models need to look good on the outside especially if there are things on the inside that might make most users choke. You have to package the model. First, it can’t look so intimidating that users break out in a sweat when they see it. Leave the equations to the technical reviewers; hide them from the naive users. USDA inspectors have to look inside sausages, but you don’t. Second, put the model in a form that can be used easily. That inch-thick report may be great documentation, but it’ll garner more dust than users. If your users are familiar with Excel, program the model as a spreadsheet. If you know a computer language, put the model in a standalone application. A model is only as successful as the use to which it is put.

       "42659  Charlie Kufs Nov 21, 2010·9 min read The problem is all about your scales, she said to me. The R-squares will be better if you’ve matched ’em mathematically. It’s just a way to make your model fit nicely. There must be fifty ways to fix your data. She said it’s really not my preference to transform. ’Cause sometimes, the new scales confuse, overfit, or misinform. But I’ll Box-Cox ’em all if it means they’ll fit the norm. There must be fifty ways to fix your data. Fifty ways to fix your data. Take the tails for a trim, Kim. Try a replace, Grace. You can use the rank, Hank. Just try ’em and see. Make it more smooth, Suz. Lots of functions you can choose. A higher degree, Dee. Will get you more fee. Sing to the tune of “Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover” by Paul Simon. In exploring a dataset, you need to be sure that you have the right numbers and that those numbers are right. You need to find and fix problems with individual data points like errors and outliers. You need to find and fix problems with observations like censored data and replicates. And you need to find and fix problems with variables like their frequency distributions and their correlations with other variables. Often, rehabilitating variables involves transformations, methods of changing the scales of your variables that might further your analyses. As part of this process, you should consider what other information you can add that might be relevant to your analysis. This is especially important if you are planning to develop an exploratory model. Experience will tell you when expanding your dataset might make a difference and when it won’t. If you don’t have that experience yet, start by learning about why you might transform variables and how it can be done. Then practice; try a variety of different techniques and learn along the way. But first you need to understand some of the pros and cons of what you might do to your dataset. There is some controversy over the use of transformations (and other methods of creating new variables) that has caused a few statisticians to argue forcefully either for or against their use. The three most common arguments that have been made against the use of transformations involve: There is a single simple argument for the use of transformations — they work better than the original variable scales. If they don’t work better, you don’t use them. William of Ockham would have liked that argument. Think of pH. It’s really the negative log of the hydrogen-ion concentration. Standard deviation is just a square-root transformation of variance. So what constitutes working better? Consider these examples of the three ways that transformations are used. One, perhaps the most important use of transformations is to reduce the effects of violations of statistical assumptions. If you plan to do any statistical analysis that involves using a Normal (or other) distribution as a model of your dependent variable, it’s important to use a scale that makes the data fit the distribution as closely as possible. If the data aren’t a good fit for the distribution, probabilities calculated for some tests and statistics will be in error. Because costly or risky decisions may be made from these probabilities, inaccuracies can be a big deal. So using a transformation to correct violations of statistical assumptions is a very important use. Two, perhaps the most common use of transformations is to find scales that optimize the linear correlation between data for a dependent variable and data for independent variables. Model building almost always benefits from this use of transformations. Everybody does it. Three, perhaps the most overlooked use of transformations is, in a word, convenience. Sometimes transformations are used to convert measured data to more familiar units, improve computational efficiency, eliminate replicates, reduce the number of variables, and other actions that facilitate, but not necessarily improve, the analysis. Now that you’ve been warned, here are four things you can do that might further your analyses: There is nothing sacred about this classification. Some of the categories might overlap or omit other ideas, so use these examples to stimulate your own thinking. In time, you’ll develop a sense of what you need for a particular analysis. Sample adjustments involve changing individual data points for a variable. Unlike most transformations which result in the creation of a new variable, sample adjustments leave the original variable intact. You use adjustments to correct errors, fill in missing data, reveal censored data, rein in unrepresentative replicates, and accommodate outliers. Using sample adjustments is a good place to start enhancing your data set. They are like digging out weeds and filling in holes before you plant a new lawn. It wouldn’t make sense to do it later, or worse, not at all. After you’ve filled all the holes in your data matrix with sample adjustments, the next thing you should do is to make sure the dependent variable approximates a Normal (or other appropriate) distribution. If you haven’t looked at histograms and other indicators of Normality, always do that first. Then, if your data distribution differs enough from the Normal distribution to make you nervous about your analysis, try a transformation of the dependent variable. Try several, in fact. Transformations of dependent variables create new variables but you’ll keep only one of the candidate dependent variables for an analysis. You’ll want to pick the candidate dependent variable that fits a theoretical distribution best so that calculations of test probabilities are most accurate. If the frequency distribution of your dependent variable is skewed toward higher values, try a root transformation. If the frequency distribution is skewed toward lower values, try a power transformation. Better yet, try a Box-Cox transformation. Box-Cox transformations include the most commonly used transformations — roots, powers, reciprocals, and logs — as well as an infinite number of minor variations in between. The only downside is that the process is labor intensive if you don’t have software that performs the analysis. If the goal of your analysis is prediction, transforming your dependent variable can be problematical. Predictions would be of the transformed variable which may not have an easily understandable scale. If that is the case, you would have to back-transform the prediction to the original understandable scale. This can become mathematically complex if tou used a Box-Cox transformation or if you plan to calculate confidence intervals. Once you have the dependent variable you want to work with, you can go on to examine all the relationships between that dependent variable and the independent variables. While the target for transforming a dependent variable is the Normal frequency distribution, the target for transforming independent variables is a straight-line correlation between the dependent variable and each independent variable. This can be a lot of work. Remember, you have to look at correlations and plots, perhaps even for special groupings of the data. That’s the reason you always start by finding a scale for the dependent variable that fits a Normal distribution. You wouldn’t want to repeat this process for more than one dependent variable if you didn’t have to. Variable adjustments are changes, some quite minor, made to all the values for a variable (as opposed to just modifying specific data points as in sample adjustments). All variable adjustments create new independent variables for analysis. Examples of variable adjustments include: Sometimes it can be useful to change the scale or units of a variable to simplify or facilitate an analysis, by: Changing the scale of a variable is different from changing the units of a variable. Both are important. Changing units usually involves only simple mathematical calculations with or without the addition or deletion of information. Rescaling variables involves adding or removing information or changing a point-of-reference. Rescaling usually involves making changes based on logic but may include mathematical considerations as well. Recoding is perhaps the most common way of rescaling a variable. Some statistical software have utilities to facilitate recoding. Improving the correlation between a dependent variable and an independent variable is a big part of modeling. The objectives of this type of transformation are (1) to persuade the data to follow a straight line, and (2) minimize the scatter of the data around the line. Here are a few examples of mathematical functions used as transformations. Variable combinations are new variables created from two or more existing variables using simple arithmetic operations (sums, differences, products, and ratios) or more complex mathematical functions. Variable combinations should be based on theory rather than created for convenience. Usually the variables combined should have the same units (e.g., dollars), although units can be standardized using z-scores. You won’t necessarily just add variables at the beginning of your analysis. You may add them continuously throughout your analysis as you learn more about your data. Some variables may turn out to be critical to the analysis and others will just facilitate reporting or some other ancillary function. Supplemental variables can be created by concatenating or partitioning existing variables, or by adding new information from metadata or external references (e.g., federal census data). When your instructor gave you a dataset in Statistics 101, that was it. You did what the assignment called for, got the desired answer, and you were finished. But it doesn’t work that way in the real world overflowing with data but lacking in wisdom. You have to put more effort into making sense of things. Statistics is the mortar that brings data and metadata together to make building blocks of information into a temple of wisdom. Transformations are like mason’s tools. They can smooth, reshape, adjust, add texture, augment, condense, and on and on. Suffice it to say that with transformations, there must be at least fifty ways to fix your data.

The challenges of keeping the “science” in data science.Exploring raw data without some kind of direction is like rummaging through a junkyard.

If you’re not willing to get your hands dirty though, cut your salary expectations in half and apply for some research grants.Science is a ProcessCarl Sagan wrote, “for me, it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.” Too often, I see data scientists and analysts unintentionally acting as propaganda machines, weaving stories with data that unconsciously proliferate confirmation and hindsight bias. Claiming to be “data-driven” is easy in a world full of data, but the reality is that without discipline, it often leads people to believe that a steaming pile of garbage is a hot, nutritious meal.Science aims to explain and understand the natural world. A major part of the process is obtaining accurate measurements and analyzing them to draw conclusions. When data is collected and analyzed in this fashion, it is incredibly powerful. Organizations that want to be data-driven should really be striving to use more evidence-based practices. The emphasis here is on striving because the standards of science are often unattainable outside of the lab and true randomized control trials.Sweep the FloorsWithout context and methodology, data is not evidence, it’s just raw information that may or may not be useful. Our challenge as data scientists, is to apply the scientific method approximately by establishing context without creating unnecessary friction. This is a tough balance to strike, and you can’t make everyone happy, but that’s not the job. The job is to use data to explain and understand the world around you.This is hard enough so don’t rediscover the scientific method through personal failure. Be disciplined and trust the 500 year old process. I try to remember that this is a dirty kind of science that’s never going to be perfectly clean. So rather than hold a standard that might actually get me fired for slowing everything down, I think of it like sweeping the floors so other work can get done. Pushing the broom is following the steps of the scientific method.1. QuestionAlways begin with curiosity. Identify an unknown that’s motivating for your organization like why certain customers make repeat purchases. This can also be more specific like how might we design a better signup experience or develop an app to motivate healthy habits. The key to this step is clearly identifying the unknown and documenting it. This will provide direction and motivation for the rest of the process. We’re all curious by nature so lean into it.2. HypothesizeNext, formulate a clear hypothesis. This is equivalent to declaring an explanation for the unknown identified in the previous step. The hypothesis should be written in the form of a statement like “simplifying the signup process will improve conversion.” When writing the hypothesis, keep an eye on the next step to help tighten it up. For example, “the signup process is too complicated” doesn’t lead to an obvious prediction while “simplifying the signup process will improve conversion” does.A good hypothesis is falsifiable, which means evidence can disprove or falsify it. The statement “an alien spaceship crashed in Roswell” is not falsifiable because if it isn’t true, there will only be an absence of evidence. However, “no spaceships have ever landed in Roswell” is falsifiable. Find a single spaceship and the statement is disproven. Too many organizations hold non-falsifiable beliefs like “people are loyal to our brand.” Pushing these kinds of beliefs is like using candy to calm a child with bad behavior. Don’t take the easy way out. Be a scientist.3. PredictArmed with a clear hypothesis, it’s time to put the chips on the table and make a prediction. Take the logical consequences of the hypothesis and commit to an outcome that can be supported with evidence. For example, “if we simplify the signup experience, conversion will increase by at least 1%” is a prediction that could actually be tested. Predictions often map to multiple hypotheses or explanations so it’s important to be specific and link it closely to the primary investigation.In practice, the predictions we want to make are often not feasible to test properly or they might pose a political challenge. This is where discipline is critical. Write down predictions as if anything is possible and then assess the feasibility of testing. Not taking this step is a slippery slope because it quickly leads to avoiding predictions altogether. The overwhelming majority of the predictions I make are impossible to test due to lack of time, resources or my inability to bend the laws of physics. Nonetheless, I don’t limit my imagination and write things down.4. ExperimentNow it’s time to commit some time and effort to conducting an experiment. This is the gold standard for acquiring knowledge and doing it properly isn’t trivial. For example, testing the impact of a simpler signup experience requires designing the new experience, deploying it in parallel with the current one, randomly assigning new users to different groups, and tracking metrics within each. This comes with hard development costs as well as the opportunity cost of the other things you passed on.Sometimes, these tests can be as simple as changing a button color or font, but in my opinion, there’s not much knowledge to be gained there. Quick A/B tests like that are great for fine-tuning, but they don’t give us much in terms of explaining or understanding our world. Meaningful discoveries have substantial cost and risk. We have to spend resources to acquire knowledge and risk being wrong about our hypotheses. Science is hard and this is usually where outside pressure poisons the process.On the other hand, not everything is science for us. It would be crazy to put every idea through a rigorous experimentation process. Sometimes, it’s just better to simplify the signup experience and ship it with confidence because it’s the reasonable thing to do. The competition moves quickly and being able to discern the value of new knowledge relative to the cost of acquiring it is a seriously advanced skill.5. AnalyzeFinally, data! If you did the hard work of defining a clear hypothesis, making a falsifiable prediction, and running a clean experiment, then this should be as straightforward as comparing two group statistics and sharing the results. In that case, the challenge is usually sorting out ambiguity and communicating statistical concepts to non-technical people. This is a great place for young data scientists and analysts to cut their teeth in the business world. More often than not though, it’s not this clean.Things get dirty as you lose the important components of a randomized control trial. Maybe you can’t randomize the group assignment or are unable to create experimental groups altogether. You might be forced to analyze time-series data or hunt for a natural experiment to detect the desired effect. In any case, the analysis should always come after a prediction has been made. If you can’t run an experiment, make a hard commitment to what evidence will look like BEFORE you look for it and be extremely clear about the concessions you made.Statisticians often take pride in developing more and more sophisticated methods to deal with messy situations like these. This is a race to the bottom if I’ve ever seen one. Sometimes, the data just isn’t there and an inaccurate conclusion is worse than no conclusion at all. At least “we don’t know” is honest and leaves the problem open for further investigation. The further you get from a clean, properly randomized experiment for testing a prediction, the more uncomfortable you should be. That said, don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty and try. Just be honest and protect your integrity by documenting the necessary concessions.ConclusionI often hear very smart, well-intending people say things like “anything is better than nothing” when it’s not possible to follow the scientific method rigorously. I tend to agree with the sentiment, but would use for more careful language: “more accuracy is preferred but not always attainable.” Would you rather have no ruler or a randomly inaccurate ruler? With no ruler, I have a well-posed problem: find a good ruler. With a flawed ruler, I might end up creating much bigger problems without realizing it.The goal of science is to explain and understand the world. The scientific method provides clear steps for identifying and acquiring the knowledge necessary to do this. Applying it in various contexts requires discipline and perspective.

       "      <td>Dirty Science: Discipline in Practice. The challenges of keeping the “science” in data science.Exploring raw data without some kind of direction is like rummaging through a junkyard. Sure, the junkyard might have a valuable antique in it and you might even stumble upon it. Then again, you might just spend the afternoon sorting trash. On the other hand, if you have a specific problem that can be solved with a variety of parts and you know what to look for, it could be worth sifting through the junk.The difference is having a clear objective so it’s easy to accept/reject many items rather than assess the value of each.If you’re in an organization that collects all possible data, you’re not going to be like a scientist running experiments in a clean, white lab coat. You’re going to be sorting trash, looking for parts, and (hopefully) assembling them into something useful. While you’re not a pure scientist, the scientific method will help you with this process. If you’re not willing to get your hands dirty though, cut your salary expectations in half and apply for some research grants.Science is a ProcessCarl Sagan wrote, “for me, it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.” Too often, I see data scientists and analysts unintentionally acting as propaganda machines, weaving stories with data that unconsciously proliferate confirmation and hindsight bias. Claiming to be “data-driven” is easy in a world full of data, but the reality is that without discipline, it often leads people to believe that a steaming pile of garbage is a hot, nutritious meal.Science aims to explain and understand the natural world. A major part of the process is obtaining accurate measurements and analyzing them to draw conclusions. When data is collected and analyzed in this fashion, it is incredibly powerful. Organizations that want to be data-driven should really be striving to use more evidence-based practices. The emphasis here is on striving because the standards of science are often unattainable outside of the lab and true randomized control trials.Sweep the FloorsWithout context and methodology, data is not evidence, it’s just raw information that may or may not be useful. Our challenge as data scientists, is to apply the scientific method approximately by establishing context without creating unnecessary friction. This is a tough balance to strike, and you can’t make everyone happy, but that’s not the job. The job is to use data to explain and understand the world around you.This is hard enough so don’t rediscover the scientific method through personal failure. Be disciplined and trust the 500 year old process. I try to remember that this is a dirty kind of science that’s never going to be perfectly clean. So rather than hold a standard that might actually get me fired for slowing everything down, I think of it like sweeping the floors so other work can get done. Pushing the broom is following the steps of the scientific method.1. QuestionAlways begin with curiosity. Identify an unknown that’s motivating for your organization like why certain customers make repeat purchases. This can also be more specific like how might we design a better signup experience or develop an app to motivate healthy habits. The key to this step is clearly identifying the unknown and documenting it. This will provide direction and motivation for the rest of the process. We’re all curious by nature so lean into it.2. HypothesizeNext, formulate a clear hypothesis. This is equivalent to declaring an explanation for the unknown identified in the previous step. The hypothesis should be written in the form of a statement like “simplifying the signup process will improve conversion.” When writing the hypothesis, keep an eye on the next step to help tighten it up. For example, “the signup process is too complicated” doesn’t lead to an obvious prediction while “simplifying the signup process will improve conversion” does.A good hypothesis is falsifiable, which means evidence can disprove or falsify it. The statement “an alien spaceship crashed in Roswell” is not falsifiable because if it isn’t true, there will only be an absence of evidence. However, “no spaceships have ever landed in Roswell” is falsifiable. Find a single spaceship and the statement is disproven. Too many organizations hold non-falsifiable beliefs like “people are loyal to our brand.” Pushing these kinds of beliefs is like using candy to calm a child with bad behavior. Don’t take the easy way out. Be a scientist.3. PredictArmed with a clear hypothesis, it’s time to put the chips on the table and make a prediction. Take the logical consequences of the hypothesis and commit to an outcome that can be supported with evidence. For example, “if we simplify the signup experience, conversion will increase by at least 1%” is a prediction that could actually be tested. Predictions often map to multiple hypotheses or explanations so it’s important to be specific and link it closely to the primary investigation.In practice, the predictions we want to make are often not feasible to test properly or they might pose a political challenge. This is where discipline is critical. Write down predictions as if anything is possible and then assess the feasibility of testing. Not taking this step is a slippery slope because it quickly leads to avoiding predictions altogether. The overwhelming majority of the predictions I make are impossible to test due to lack of time, resources or my inability to bend the laws of physics. Nonetheless, I don’t limit my imagination and write things down.4. ExperimentNow it’s time to commit some time and effort to conducting an experiment. This is the gold standard for acquiring knowledge and doing it properly isn’t trivial. For example, testing the impact of a simpler signup experience requires designing the new experience, deploying it in parallel with the current one, randomly assigning new users to different groups, and tracking metrics within each. This comes with hard development costs as well as the opportunity cost of the other things you passed on.Sometimes, these tests can be as simple as changing a button color or font, but in my opinion, there’s not much knowledge to be gained there. Quick A/B tests like that are great for fine-tuning, but they don’t give us much in terms of explaining or understanding our world. Meaningful discoveries have substantial cost and risk. We have to spend resources to acquire knowledge and risk being wrong about our hypotheses. Science is hard and this is usually where outside pressure poisons the process.On the other hand, not everything is science for us. It would be crazy to put every idea through a rigorous experimentation process. Sometimes, it’s just better to simplify the signup experience and ship it with confidence because it’s the reasonable thing to do. The competition moves quickly and being able to discern the value of new knowledge relative to the cost of acquiring it is a seriously advanced skill.5. AnalyzeFinally, data! If you did the hard work of defining a clear hypothesis, making a falsifiable prediction, and running a clean experiment, then this should be as straightforward as comparing two group statistics and sharing the results. In that case, the challenge is usually sorting out ambiguity and communicating statistical concepts to non-technical people. This is a great place for young data scientists and analysts to cut their teeth in the business world. More often than not though, it’s not this clean.Things get dirty as you lose the important components of a randomized control trial. Maybe you can’t randomize the group assignment or are unable to create experimental groups altogether. You might be forced to analyze time-series data or hunt for a natural experiment to detect the desired effect. In any case, the analysis should always come after a prediction has been made. If you can’t run an experiment, make a hard commitment to what evidence will look like BEFORE you look for it and be extremely clear about the concessions you made.Statisticians often take pride in developing more and more sophisticated methods to deal with messy situations like these. This is a race to the bottom if I’ve ever seen one. Sometimes, the data just isn’t there and an inaccurate conclusion is worse than no conclusion at all. At least “we don’t know” is honest and leaves the problem open for further investigation. The further you get from a clean, properly randomized experiment for testing a prediction, the more uncomfortable you should be. That said, don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty and try. Just be honest and protect your integrity by documenting the necessary concessions.ConclusionI often hear very smart, well-intending people say things like “anything is better than nothing” when it’s not possible to follow the scientific method rigorously. I tend to agree with the sentiment, but would use for more careful language: “more accuracy is preferred but not always attainable.” Would you rather have no ruler or a randomly inaccurate ruler? With no ruler, I have a well-posed problem: find a good ruler. With a flawed ruler, I might end up creating much bigger problems without realizing it.The goal of science is to explain and understand the world. The scientific method provides clear steps for identifying and acquiring the knowledge necessary to do this. Applying it in various contexts requires discipline and perspective. For us, science is a process that’s mostly, but not always, useful and being able to tell the difference is a unique challenge. Data science is a dirty science. Now pick up the broom and get back to work.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lee Schlenker Mar 1, 2020·7 min read In the rush to prepare management for artificial intelligence, both Academia and CorpEd are spinning together programs of statistics, information technology, and information sciences to train future professionals for commerce and industry. Lost in the shuffle is the need to address both how AI is transforming management practices today, and how it will impact careers in management in the foreseeable future. Let’s take a moment to underline the obvious- most managers will never become data scientists, but all managers need to look beyond the data and the algorithms to explore how artificial intelligence is transforming the essence of management. What do business and engineering students need to understand about AI in Management? In the first contribution of this three-part series, we examined how AI influences the foundations of corporate strategy, the need to address the concept of “AI readiness”, and the specificities of AI project management.[i] In this contribution, we will look at three additional foundations of AI in a business setting: the importance of fostering Collaborative Intelligence, the need to improving Managerial Decision-Making, and the implications of Digital Transformation. The future of business does not belong to chatbots, cybots and cobots, but to managers that have learned to adapt organizations to leverage new forms of human-machine collaboration. Collaborative intelligence refers to the design of networks of human and machine agents that play to their mutual strengths in fostering the crowdsourcing of knowledge, expertise, and preferences. Management alone can define the division of labor between human and machine agents and establish the rules that govern acceptable behavior. As algorithms demonstrate their value in automating repetitive tasks, managers prove their worth in understanding how and where to match human and machine intelligence. Management will need to encourage both communication and meaning in discussions that will be increasingly both asynchronous and virtual. Last but certainly not least, managers will be held accountable for resolving the inevitable conflicts that will arise when algorithms are used to address the complexity of human interaction. If the goal of artificial intelligence is to enhance human potential, it’s management’s responsibility to discern what it means to be human. Training management to nurture collaborative intelligence can focus on how to operationalize an “augmentation strategy” efficiently and effectively.[ii] Case studies on the theme can explore the challenges of leveraging the network effects of human and machine agents in dotted-line organizations where managers and employees act as independent contractors. Workshops can focus on the practice of change management and challenges of designing patterns of transformation that regulate the pace of change. Far from the mechanics of data and algorithms, management must be prepared to encourage their ecosystems to leverage AI to co-develop human and machine intelligence. Machine agents will never be any better than the computer program behind them Automated decision-making provides a case in point. On the upside, algorithms promise us more efficient processes and more consistent decisions that will allow managers more time to focus on improving the business. On the downside, machine agents will never be any better than the program behind them. In cases where the agents rely on deep learning algorithms integrating artificial neural networks or support vector machines, the how and the why of each decision can prove very difficult to explain. Their output will be continuously challenged as being unfair, illegal, or erroneous. As a result, regulations like Europe’s GDPR require companies to provide specific justification for each algorithmic-based decision affecting employment, health, purchasing or credit. Human and machine agents will need to develop collaborative intelligence in communicating both with each other and with consumers. Managers don’t act on data, but on their perceptions of the what the data represents. Machine learning is about developing algorithms capable of learning from data, elucidating patterns and connections, and providing insights in supporting human decision-making. Yet in decision science, we learn that the major challenges to decision-making are human perceptions of the complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty of the environment in which we take decisions. In the cognitive sciences, we explore how our pre-conceptions and prejudices distort how we see the problem and limit our ability to propose innovative solutions. Studying artificial intelligence in isolation is as short-sighted as it is useless, for practitioners need to understand the complexity and the diversity of human decision-making. Programs on managerial decision-making can focus on where and when machine learning can help managers transform data into action. Coursework can help participants understand the role of modeling, the nature of specific decision environments, and the impact of cognitive biases in the data, algorithms, and logic. Case studies can elucidate the place of heuristics and algorithms in perception, prediction evaluation, and insight. As a whole, there programs can be designed to develop the participants’ ability to “solve” business problems through the analytic method: evaluating the context, identifying the roots of the problem, evaluating the quality of the data, choosing the right methodology to address the problem, and creating the conditions for collective action. As long as we purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm B2C Marketing provides multiple examples of the complexity of managerial decision-making. AI modeling and simulation techniques can certainly be leveraged to construct relevant buyer personas and to predict consumer behavior trends.[iii] Yet as long as human beings purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm. Each marketing decision requires understanding customers’ needs, appreciating the temporal impact of the of community, culture and economy on consumption, and aligning each organization’s product and service offer. Decision environments, cognitive biases, and consumer preferences inherently influence how individuals and organizations view the data at hand. B2C Marketing isn’t a question of data and outcomes, but of the processes of perception, prediction, evaluation, and insight that influence consumption and production. [iv] The term digital transformation suggests that digital technology provokes fundamental changes in how businesses deliver value to their stakeholders. Although the concept originally reflected a vision of transforming « atoms to bits » it has evolved over the last decade to encompass a mindset about how managers and their stockholders view their businesses. Digital transformation is not about hardware, software and data, but rather technology’s role in providing management insight into what’s core to the business, and how their organization works with customers. As importantly, experience demonstrates that digital technologies don’t change companies and markets, people do. The current objectives of digital transformation: the use of AI and machine learning, the adoption of digital operating models, the creation of new digital partnerships, and the evaluation of a company’s digital assets, underline the importance of management training in any digital initiative. Coursework can help participants understand that digital transformation isn’t an « IT project » any more than the responsibility for its success lies with the Data Science or IT teams. Case studies can provide ample room for debate and discussion around the role of management in setting an appropriate vision for each project, as well as pertinent methodologies and evaluation metrics in specific contexts. Workshops can provide the necessary room to explore the need to foster cultures of risk taking and overcome organizational barriers to change. If these companies view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers Platform business models like Airbnb, Uber or Amazon provide ample food for thought. Although each make extensive use of artificial intelligence, the value of each case is neither in the data they capture nor in the algorithms they use. They view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers. [v] When analyzing the impact of digital transformation inside these companies we need to look beyond their digital infrastructure to explore how their data practices support their business models, business processes, and revenue streams. The value of their business can not be calculated as the sum of their material and immaterial resources, but in how their vision of digital transformation has encouraged both their customers and employees to think differently about doing business. Training in Artificial Intelligence today needs to help managers look beyond data and algorithms and explore how AI has transformed organizations and markets. The future success of business endeavors doesn’t depend on AI, but managers capable of leveraging digital technologies to enhance human potential. In this contribution we have addressed three themes that should be at the core of any Data Science program: Collaborative Intelligence, Managerial Decision-Making, and Digital Transformation. In each vision, management skills rather than just technical savvy prove fundamental in aligning the promise of AI with each organization’s strategy, resources, and culture. In the final contribution in this series on the role of management in AI we will look at the importance of Digital Ethics and AI’s influence on innovation.[vi] Lee Schlenker is the Principal in the BAI http://baieurope.com and Professor of Business Analytics and Community Management.

Well… you’re here now, so let’s get it done. You’ll be surprised to find you’re likely familiar with what goes into creating your own chatbot It may be to query a simple database, make an order, reservation, customer service, and much more. We interact with chatbots every day. Chatbots are all about what’s called a rule matching engine. In the simplest form; that pretty much means that when you get a message, what do you do with it? One way you could do this is just by repeating back what was originally typed. While it seems overly simple and uninteresting, this idea serves as a good foundation before you branch into more complexity with your chatbot. Let’s get our hands dirty def parrot_talk(incoming_message): bot_response = \"Hi, my name is Randy the Parrot, you said: \" + message return bot_response print(parrot_talk(\"hello!\")) Obviously that’s a simple example, let’s take it up a notch. responses = { \"Hello\": \"Hey! How can I help you?\", \"I need a refund\": \"I'm happy to help, can you give me more detail?\" } def respond(message): if message in responses: return responses[message] respond(\"I need a refund?\") Similar to what you saw the first time, here is a customer service chatbot. What we’re doing in the above dictionary is establishing keys that should relate to what our customers might say… those keys then map to an appropriate response. Now obviously the limitation here is that it would require the message to be exactly the same as the key in the dictionary. We can very quickly become far rigorous, using things like regular expressions on any given message, creating a flag to indicate the presence of various terms in the text &amp; then keying off of that flag to populate our response. To take it even further, we could deploy ML algorithms that could predict whether or not a message falls under a given intent or topic which we could then map back to the dictionary of appropriate responses. Have you ever seen the auto responses in LinkedIn? You should try to have a conversation by just tapping those prompts… beyond being fun, it’s an interesting exploration in the sophistication as well as the lack thereof. Among the toughest things for chatbots is the ability to track the state of any given conversation, which will be very obvious once you go and have that chat in LinkedIn. Chatbots are surprisingly simple to create at first glance. Happy Data Science-ing!</td>\n",

How do you debug the code to identify and resolve the root cause? Logging is the process of recording the flow of code as it executes along with capturing any other events that occur during execution like Out Of Memory(OOM) issues or hard disk issues. Logging is usually done in files that can be retrieved later for analysis or troubleshooting. Using logs, we can capture the key information in the classes and function of our code. Log helps with What should you capture as part of the logs that will help to troubleshoot? Logs should be very detailed containing a descriptive message containing How to implement logging in Python? Python provides a library “logging” to write messages to a file or any other output stream like the standard output. Different levels of logging in the order of their severity A simple code to use logging and different severity options We log message structure is severity level like WARNING, followed by the default logging module root, followed by the message. We see that debug and info messages are not displayed. Logging module by default only displays messages with a severity level of warning and above What if you are debugging the code and want to show the messages for severity levels of Debug and Info? We use basicConfig() to set basic configuration for the logging system. basicConfig() will not take new settings into considerations if the root logger is already configured. I had to restart my kernel for the above code to work properly as the first time any of the logging function is called it configures the root logger internally. Common basicConfig() parameters filename: Specify the filename to which we want to write the log message filemode: Specify the mode in which the file needs to be opened like ‘w’ for write, ‘a’ for append. Default file mode is ‘a’ format: Specify the format string available as attributes in LogRecord datefmt: Specify the date format we want in the log messages. The format should be accepted by time.strftime() level: Severity level that you want to set for the root logger The following code snippet will demonstrate logging in classes and function. We create a TestLog class with the divide(); it takes two parameters and returns the division. In case there is an error in the division, we want to have the stack trace in the log file Creating an instance of the TestLog class and calling divide() For displaying a stack trace, we need to set exc_info as True in the except block of the Exception handling as done in the TestLog class Logging helps troubleshoot the application during development or after production deployment. Logging can be written in files or standard output using multiple formats, and we can also capture the stack trace. docs.python.org https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html</td>\n",

       "      <td>Quinn Wang Mar 1, 2020·7 min read You might have used the Random Forest Algorithm for your data science projects and it performs very well with little effort, especially on heterogeneous data. A random forest is made up of an ensemble of decision trees. While each decision tree is easy to interpret — split order and threshold tell a lot about what the tree is prioritizing and how it's making decisions — the ensemble of trees is more of a black box. In a binary classification problem, a random forest classifier generally works better than a decision tree classifier. This can be explained by the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution B(n, p) is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success. Given a binomial distribution, we can easily find the probability of exactly k, 0≤k≤n, successes from the probability mass function. Define X as the random variable that follows B(n, p), then Pr(X = k) is given by: Where: Which is the probability of k successes with probability p, and n-k failures with probability 1-p, scaled up by all combinations of which successes and failures can be ordered. Then for any k and p: This equation means that the probability of success for more than half of the trials is greater than the probability of success for each individual trial. When translated to “forest language”, this is saying: assuming each tree in the forest is independent of one another and the probability of making the correct prediction from each tree is constant and greater than 50%, then the probability of more than half of the trees giving the correct predictions is greater than the probability of any individual tree making the correct prediction. A key assumption here is the independence between any two decision trees in the forest. In reality, when trees are trained using the same dataset, this assumption is improbable to be satisfied. Hence introducing randomness. The idea is that if we incorporate stochasticities into the build of each decision tree, they will be more independent of one another. Stochasticities are introduced by methods such as: Learning about these randomnesses will help us understand, or at least tame, the black box a little better. Sometimes when we replicate results, certain procedures might be overlooked because we assume they wouldn't affect the model's performance. Then we might be stuck at figuring out why our results didn't match expectations, and that is a really frustrating process because there are so many things that could potentially go wrong. The randomness I listed above is very well known in the random forest algorithm. Therefore, when someone writes a report about his/her model he/she would likely make sure readers don't get different results because of these randomnesses. To tackle each: So the above randomness can be avoided by simply disclosing all hyperparameters. However, there is another place where potential randomness may occur: whether we include a set of constant features. When I first started using the random forest algorithm, I completely overlooked the impact of constant features, and was very confused when including a set of constant features changed my model's performance. It shouldn't matter whether a set of constant features are included, right? Nodes cannot split on a constant feature because every data point takes the same value. As a result, constant features are never used as a splitting criterion in a decision tree. If we print out the feature_importances_, we will see that importance is always zero for any of these features. Nodes just examine them and discard them. The problem lies in how nodes deal with these features: examine, and then discard. Let's say max_features is set to five, when building tree T (a tree we randomly select to take a closer look at) in the forest: the root of T is going to select five features in a sequence predetermined by the total number of features and random_state. It will then pick the best one to split from, and split into two child nodes. This process repeats for each child node and eventually terminates if one of the limitations set by our hyperparameters is met, or if the node is pure (containing data from only one class). Let's say we train T with 100 non-constant features, and suppose the predetermined feature indices are [2, 99, 53, 15, 76] for the root node, [17, 22, 23, 81, 59] for its left child, and [47, 34, 65, 16, 67] for its right child. For simplicity of illustration, assume the usefulness of a feature increases as the index increases. Additionally, assume that max_depth is set to two. The set of three features T ends up splitting by is [99, 81, 67]. Now if we add 50 constant features, and assign them ids 100 to 149. Say the predetermined sequence with 150 total number of features is [104, 134, 85, 29, 3] for the root node, [0, 39,124, 91, 56] for its left child, and [94, 20, 100, 4, 80] for its right child. Since a splitter ignores a constant feature when it sees one, features with id ≥ 100 will not be picked even though they take up space as one of the five features a node can examine. The set of three features T ends up splitting by in this scenario is [85, 91, 94], which is different from the first scenario and is an overall more useful set. What happened to T generalizes to all trees in the forest, and will hence change the forest’s performance. Adding constant features affects feature usefulness in two ways: In conclusion, whether a set of constant features is included will affect a forest's performance. In a way, having a lot of constant features will add more randomness to the forest, because at each node, the max_features is effectively changing randomly. Beware of this effect next time you consider constant features as irrelevant.</td>\n",

The challenges of keeping the “science” in data science.Exploring raw data without some kind of direction is like rummaging through a junkyard. Sure, the junkyard might have a valuable antique in it and you might even stumble upon it. Then again, you might just spend the afternoon sorting trash. On the other hand, if you have a specific problem that can be solved with a variety of parts and you know what to look for, it could be worth sifting through the junk.The difference is having a clear objective so it’s easy to accept/reject many items rather than assess the value of each.If you’re in an organization that collects all possible data, you’re not going to be like a scientist running experiments in a clean, white lab coat. You’re going to be sorting trash, looking for parts, and (hopefully) assembling them into something useful. While you’re not a pure scientist, the scientific method will help you with this process. If you’re not willing to get your hands dirty though, cut your salary expectations in half and apply for some research grants.Science is a ProcessCarl Sagan wrote, “for me, it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.” Too often, I see data scientists and analysts unintentionally acting as propaganda machines, weaving stories with data that unconsciously proliferate confirmation and hindsight bias. Claiming to be “data-driven” is easy in a world full of data, but the reality is that without discipline, it often leads people to believe that a steaming pile of garbage is a hot, nutritious meal.Science aims to explain and understand the natural world. A major part of the process is obtaining accurate measurements and analyzing them to draw conclusions. When data is collected and analyzed in this fashion, it is incredibly powerful. Organizations that want to be data-driven should really be striving to use more evidence-based practices. The emphasis here is on striving because the standards of science are often unattainable outside of the lab and true randomized control trials.Sweep the FloorsWithout context and methodology, data is not evidence, it’s just raw information that may or may not be useful. Our challenge as data scientists, is to apply the scientific method approximately by establishing context without creating unnecessary friction. This is a tough balance to strike, and you can’t make everyone happy, but that’s not the job. The job is to use data to explain and understand the world around you.This is hard enough so don’t rediscover the scientific method through personal failure. Be disciplined and trust the 500 year old process. I try to remember that this is a dirty kind of science that’s never going to be perfectly clean. So rather than hold a standard that might actually get me fired for slowing everything down, I think of it like sweeping the floors so other work can get done. Pushing the broom is following the steps of the scientific method.1. QuestionAlways begin with curiosity. Identify an unknown that’s motivating for your organization like why certain customers make repeat purchases. This can also be more specific like how might we design a better signup experience or develop an app to motivate healthy habits. The key to this step is clearly identifying the unknown and documenting it. This will provide direction and motivation for the rest of the process. We’re all curious by nature so lean into it.2. HypothesizeNext, formulate a clear hypothesis. This is equivalent to declaring an explanation for the unknown identified in the previous step. The hypothesis should be written in the form of a statement like “simplifying the signup process will improve conversion.” When writing the hypothesis, keep an eye on the next step to help tighten it up. For example, “the signup process is too complicated” doesn’t lead to an obvious prediction while “simplifying the signup process will improve conversion” does.A good hypothesis is falsifiable, which means evidence can disprove or falsify it. The statement “an alien spaceship crashed in Roswell” is not falsifiable because if it isn’t true, there will only be an absence of evidence. However, “no spaceships have ever landed in Roswell” is falsifiable. Find a single spaceship and the statement is disproven. Too many organizations hold non-falsifiable beliefs like “people are loyal to our brand.” Pushing these kinds of beliefs is like using candy to calm a child with bad behavior. Don’t take the easy way out. Be a scientist.3. PredictArmed with a clear hypothesis, it’s time to put the chips on the table and make a prediction. Take the logical consequences of the hypothesis and commit to an outcome that can be supported with evidence. For example, “if we simplify the signup experience, conversion will increase by at least 1%” is a prediction that could actually be tested. Predictions often map to multiple hypotheses or explanations so it’s important to be specific and link it closely to the primary investigation.In practice, the predictions we want to make are often not feasible to test properly or they might pose a political challenge. This is where discipline is critical. Write down predictions as if anything is possible and then assess the feasibility of testing. Not taking this step is a slippery slope because it quickly leads to avoiding predictions altogether. The overwhelming majority of the predictions I make are impossible to test due to lack of time, resources or my inability to bend the laws of physics. Nonetheless, I don’t limit my imagination and write things down.4. ExperimentNow it’s time to commit some time and effort to conducting an experiment. This is the gold standard for acquiring knowledge and doing it properly isn’t trivial. For example, testing the impact of a simpler signup experience requires designing the new experience, deploying it in parallel with the current one, randomly assigning new users to different groups, and tracking metrics within each. This comes with hard development costs as well as the opportunity cost of the other things you passed on.Sometimes, these tests can be as simple as changing a button color or font, but in my opinion, there’s not much knowledge to be gained there. Quick A/B tests like that are great for fine-tuning, but they don’t give us much in terms of explaining or understanding our world. Meaningful discoveries have substantial cost and risk. We have to spend resources to acquire knowledge and risk being wrong about our hypotheses. Science is hard and this is usually where outside pressure poisons the process.On the other hand, not everything is science for us. It would be crazy to put every idea through a rigorous experimentation process. Sometimes, it’s just better to simplify the signup experience and ship it with confidence because it’s the reasonable thing to do. The competition moves quickly and being able to discern the value of new knowledge relative to the cost of acquiring it is a seriously advanced skill.5. AnalyzeFinally, data! If you did the hard work of defining a clear hypothesis, making a falsifiable prediction, and running a clean experiment, then this should be as straightforward as comparing two group statistics and sharing the results. In that case, the challenge is usually sorting out ambiguity and communicating statistical concepts to non-technical people. This is a great place for young data scientists and analysts to cut their teeth in the business world. More often than not though, it’s not this clean.Things get dirty as you lose the important components of a randomized control trial. Maybe you can’t randomize the group assignment or are unable to create experimental groups altogether. You might be forced to analyze time-series data or hunt for a natural experiment to detect the desired effect. In any case, the analysis should always come after a prediction has been made. If you can’t run an experiment, make a hard commitment to what evidence will look like BEFORE you look for it and be extremely clear about the concessions you made.Statisticians often take pride in developing more and more sophisticated methods to deal with messy situations like these. This is a race to the bottom if I’ve ever seen one. Sometimes, the data just isn’t there and an inaccurate conclusion is worse than no conclusion at all. At least “we don’t know” is honest and leaves the problem open for further investigation. The further you get from a clean, properly randomized experiment for testing a prediction, the more uncomfortable you should be. That said, don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty and try. Just be honest and protect your integrity by documenting the necessary concessions.ConclusionI often hear very smart, well-intending people say things like “anything is better than nothing” when it’s not possible to follow the scientific method rigorously. I tend to agree with the sentiment, but would use for more careful language: “more accuracy is preferred but not always attainable.” Would you rather have no ruler or a randomly inaccurate ruler? With no ruler, I have a well-posed problem: find a good ruler. With a flawed ruler, I might end up creating much bigger problems without realizing it.The goal of science is to explain and understand the world. The scientific method provides clear steps for identifying and acquiring the knowledge necessary to do this. Applying it in various contexts requires discipline and perspective. For us, science is a process that’s mostly, but not always, useful and being able to tell the difference is a unique challenge. Data science is a dirty science. Now pick up the broom and get back to work.  \n",

Lost in the shuffle is the need to address both how AI is transforming management practices today, and how it will impact careers in management in the foreseeable future. Let’s take a moment to underline the obvious- most managers will never become data scientists, but all managers need to look beyond the data and the algorithms to explore how artificial intelligence is transforming the essence of management. What do business and engineering students need to understand about AI in Management? In the first contribution of this three-part series, we examined how AI influences the foundations of corporate strategy, the need to address the concept of “AI readiness”, and the specificities of AI project management.[i] In this contribution, we will look at three additional foundations of AI in a business setting: the importance of fostering Collaborative Intelligence, the need to improving Managerial Decision-Making, and the implications of Digital Transformation. The future of business does not belong to chatbots, cybots and cobots, but to managers that have learned to adapt organizations to leverage new forms of human-machine collaboration. Collaborative intelligence refers to the design of networks of human and machine agents that play to their mutual strengths in fostering the crowdsourcing of knowledge, expertise, and preferences. Management alone can define the division of labor between human and machine agents and establish the rules that govern acceptable behavior. As algorithms demonstrate their value in automating repetitive tasks, managers prove their worth in understanding how and where to match human and machine intelligence. Management will need to encourage both communication and meaning in discussions that will be increasingly both asynchronous and virtual. Last but certainly not least, managers will be held accountable for resolving the inevitable conflicts that will arise when algorithms are used to address the complexity of human interaction. If the goal of artificial intelligence is to enhance human potential, it’s management’s responsibility to discern what it means to be human. Training management to nurture collaborative intelligence can focus on how to operationalize an “augmentation strategy” efficiently and effectively.[ii] Case studies on the theme can explore the challenges of leveraging the network effects of human and machine agents in dotted-line organizations where managers and employees act as independent contractors. Workshops can focus on the practice of change management and challenges of designing patterns of transformation that regulate the pace of change. Far from the mechanics of data and algorithms, management must be prepared to encourage their ecosystems to leverage AI to co-develop human and machine intelligence. Machine agents will never be any better than the computer program behind them Automated decision-making provides a case in point. On the upside, algorithms promise us more efficient processes and more consistent decisions that will allow managers more time to focus on improving the business. On the downside, machine agents will never be any better than the program behind them. In cases where the agents rely on deep learning algorithms integrating artificial neural networks or support vector machines, the how and the why of each decision can prove very difficult to explain. Their output will be continuously challenged as being unfair, illegal, or erroneous. As a result, regulations like Europe’s GDPR require companies to provide specific justification for each algorithmic-based decision affecting employment, health, purchasing or credit. Human and machine agents will need to develop collaborative intelligence in communicating both with each other and with consumers. Managers don’t act on data, but on their perceptions of the what the data represents. Machine learning is about developing algorithms capable of learning from data, elucidating patterns and connections, and providing insights in supporting human decision-making. Yet in decision science, we learn that the major challenges to decision-making are human perceptions of the complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty of the environment in which we take decisions. In the cognitive sciences, we explore how our pre-conceptions and prejudices distort how we see the problem and limit our ability to propose innovative solutions. Studying artificial intelligence in isolation is as short-sighted as it is useless, for practitioners need to understand the complexity and the diversity of human decision-making. Programs on managerial decision-making can focus on where and when machine learning can help managers transform data into action. Coursework can help participants understand the role of modeling, the nature of specific decision environments, and the impact of cognitive biases in the data, algorithms, and logic. Case studies can elucidate the place of heuristics and algorithms in perception, prediction evaluation, and insight. As a whole, there programs can be designed to develop the participants’ ability to “solve” business problems through the analytic method: evaluating the context, identifying the roots of the problem, evaluating the quality of the data, choosing the right methodology to address the problem, and creating the conditions for collective action. As long as we purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm B2C Marketing provides multiple examples of the complexity of managerial decision-making. AI modeling and simulation techniques can certainly be leveraged to construct relevant buyer personas and to predict consumer behavior trends.[iii] Yet as long as human beings purchase and consume, the essence of marketing will never be captured in an algorithm. Each marketing decision requires understanding customers’ needs, appreciating the temporal impact of the of community, culture and economy on consumption, and aligning each organization’s product and service offer. Decision environments, cognitive biases, and consumer preferences inherently influence how individuals and organizations view the data at hand. B2C Marketing isn’t a question of data and outcomes, but of the processes of perception, prediction, evaluation, and insight that influence consumption and production. [iv] The term digital transformation suggests that digital technology provokes fundamental changes in how businesses deliver value to their stakeholders. Although the concept originally reflected a vision of transforming « atoms to bits » it has evolved over the last decade to encompass a mindset about how managers and their stockholders view their businesses. Digital transformation is not about hardware, software and data, but rather technology’s role in providing management insight into what’s core to the business, and how their organization works with customers. As importantly, experience demonstrates that digital technologies don’t change companies and markets, people do. The current objectives of digital transformation: the use of AI and machine learning, the adoption of digital operating models, the creation of new digital partnerships, and the evaluation of a company’s digital assets, underline the importance of management training in any digital initiative. Coursework can help participants understand that digital transformation isn’t an « IT project » any more than the responsibility for its success lies with the Data Science or IT teams. Case studies can provide ample room for debate and discussion around the role of management in setting an appropriate vision for each project, as well as pertinent methodologies and evaluation metrics in specific contexts. Workshops can provide the necessary room to explore the need to foster cultures of risk taking and overcome organizational barriers to change. If these companies view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers Platform business models like Airbnb, Uber or Amazon provide ample food for thought. Although each make extensive use of artificial intelligence, the value of each case is neither in the data they capture nor in the algorithms they use. They view data as nothing more than a reflection of the reality of their market, they see data-driven decision-making as nothing less than their vision of how they deliver value to the customers. [v] When analyzing the impact of digital transformation inside these companies we need to look beyond their digital infrastructure to explore how their data practices support their business models, business processes, and revenue streams. The value of their business can not be calculated as the sum of their material and immaterial resources, but in how their vision of digital transformation has encouraged both their customers and employees to think differently about doing business. Training in Artificial Intelligence today needs to help managers look beyond data and algorithms and explore how AI has transformed organizations and markets. The future success of business endeavors doesn’t depend on AI, but managers capable of leveraging digital technologies to enhance human potential. In this contribution we have addressed three themes that should be at the core of any Data Science program: Collaborative Intelligence, Managerial Decision-Making, and Digital Transformation. In each vision, management skills rather than just technical savvy prove fundamental in aligning the promise of AI with each organization’s strategy, resources, and culture. In the final contribution in this series on the role of management in AI we will look at the importance of Digital Ethics and AI’s influence on innovation.[vi] Lee Schlenker is the Principal in the BAI http://baieurope.com and Professor of Business Analytics and Community Management.

                  Robert Wood Mar 1, 2020·2 min read Whether you’re a data scientist, data analyst, or software engineer; and whether you have a strong handle on NLP tools and approaches, if you’re here, you’ve likely wondered how a chatbot works and how to build one, but haven’t ever had the need or chance. Well… you’re here now, so let’s get it done. You’ll be surprised to find you’re likely familiar with what goes into creating your own chatbot It may be to query a simple database, make an order, reservation, customer service, and much more. We interact with chatbots every day. Chatbots are all about what’s called a rule matching engine. In the simplest form; that pretty much means that when you get a message, what do you do with it? One way you could do this is just by repeating back what was originally typed. While it seems overly simple and uninteresting, this idea serves as a good foundation before you branch into more complexity with your chatbot. Let’s get our hands dirty def parrot_talk(incoming_message): bot_response = \"Hi, my name is Randy the Parrot, you said: \" + message return bot_response print(parrot_talk(\"hello!\")) Obviously that’s a simple example, let’s take it up a notch. responses = { \"Hello\": \"Hey! How can I help you?\", \"I need a refund\": \"I'm happy to help, can you give me more detail?\" } def respond(message): if message in responses: return responses[message] respond(\"I need a refund?\") Similar to what you saw the first time, here is a customer service chatbot. What we’re doing in the above dictionary is establishing keys that should relate to what our customers might say… those keys then map to an appropriate response. Now obviously the limitation here is that it would require the message to be exactly the same as the key in the dictionary. We can very quickly become far rigorous, using things like regular expressions on any given message, creating a flag to indicate the presence of various terms in the text & then keying off of that flag to populate our response. To take it even further, we could deploy ML algorithms that could predict whether or not a message falls under a given intent or topic which we could then map back to the dictionary of appropriate responses. Have you ever seen the auto responses in LinkedIn? You should try to have a conversation by just tapping those prompts… beyond being fun, it’s an interesting exploration in the sophistication as well as the lack thereof. Among the toughest things for chatbots is the ability to track the state of any given conversation, which will be very obvious once you go and have that chat in LinkedIn. Chatbots are surprisingly simple to create at first glance. Happy Data Science-ing!  \n",

are getting undesired results or, the code is deployed in production and has started giving undesired results. How do you debug the code to identify and resolve the root cause? Logging is the process of recording the flow of code as it executes along with capturing any other events that occur during execution like Out Of Memory(OOM) issues or hard disk issues. Logging is usually done in files that can be retrieved later for analysis or troubleshooting. Using logs, we can capture the key information in the classes and function of our code. Log helps with What should you capture as part of the logs that will help to troubleshoot? Logs should be very detailed containing a descriptive message containing How to implement logging in Python? Python provides a library “logging” to write messages to a file or any other output stream like the standard output. Different levels of logging in the order of their severity A simple code to use logging and different severity options We log message structure is severity level like WARNING, followed by the default logging module root, followed by the message. We see that debug and info messages are not displayed. Logging module by default only displays messages with a severity level of warning and above What if you are debugging the code and want to show the messages for severity levels of Debug and Info? We use basicConfig() to set basic configuration for the logging system. basicConfig() will not take new settings into considerations if the root logger is already configured. I had to restart my kernel for the above code to work properly as the first time any of the logging function is called it configures the root logger internally. Common basicConfig() parameters filename: Specify the filename to which we want to write the log message filemode: Specify the mode in which the file needs to be opened like ‘w’ for write, ‘a’ for append. Default file mode is ‘a’ format: Specify the format string available as attributes in LogRecord datefmt: Specify the date format we want in the log messages. The format should be accepted by time.strftime() level: Severity level that you want to set for the root logger The following code snippet will demonstrate logging in classes and function. We create a TestLog class with the divide(); it takes two parameters and returns the division. In case there is an error in the division, we want to have the stack trace in the log file Creating an instance of the TestLog class and calling divide() For displaying a stack trace, we need to set exc_info as True in the except block of the Exception handling as done in the TestLog class Logging helps troubleshoot the application during development or after production deployment. Logging can be written in files or standard output using multiple formats, and we can also capture the stack trace. docs.python.org https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html  \n",

very well with little effort, especially on heterogeneous data. A random forest is made up of an ensemble of decision trees. While each decision tree is easy to interpret — split order and threshold tell a lot about what the tree is prioritizing and how it's making decisions — the ensemble of trees is more of a black box. In a binary classification problem, a random forest classifier generally works better than a decision tree classifier. This can be explained by the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution B(n, p) is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success. Given a binomial distribution, we can easily find the probability of exactly k, 0≤k≤n, successes from the probability mass function. Define X as the random variable that follows B(n, p), then Pr(X = k) is given by: Where: Which is the probability of k successes with probability p, and n-k failures with probability 1-p, scaled up by all combinations of which successes and failures can be ordered. Then for any k and p: This equation means that the probability of success for more than half of the trials is greater than the probability of success for each individual trial. When translated to “forest language”, this is saying: assuming each tree in the forest is independent of one another and the probability of making the correct prediction from each tree is constant and greater than 50%, then the probability of more than half of the trees giving the correct predictions is greater than the probability of any individual tree making the correct prediction. A key assumption here is the independence between any two decision trees in the forest. In reality, when trees are trained using the same dataset, this assumption is improbable to be satisfied. Hence introducing randomness. The idea is that if we incorporate stochasticities into the build of each decision tree, they will be more independent of one another. Stochasticities are introduced by methods such as: Learning about these randomnesses will help us understand, or at least tame, the black box a little better. Sometimes when we replicate results, certain procedures might be overlooked because we assume they wouldn't affect the model's performance. Then we might be stuck at figuring out why our results didn't match expectations, and that is a really frustrating process because there are so many things that could potentially go wrong. The randomness I listed above is very well known in the random forest algorithm. Therefore, when someone writes a report about his/her model he/she would likely make sure readers don't get different results because of these randomnesses. To tackle each: So the above randomness can be avoided by simply disclosing all hyperparameters. However, there is another place where potential randomness may occur: whether we include a set of constant features. When I first started using the random forest algorithm, I completely overlooked the impact of constant features, and was very confused when including a set of constant features changed my model's performance. It shouldn't matter whether a set of constant features are included, right? Nodes cannot split on a constant feature because every data point takes the same value. As a result, constant features are never used as a splitting criterion in a decision tree. If we print out the feature_importances_, we will see that importance is always zero for any of these features. Nodes just examine them and discard them. The problem lies in how nodes deal with these features: examine, and then discard. Let's say max_features is set to five, when building tree T (a tree we randomly select to take a closer look at) in the forest: the root of T is going to select five features in a sequence predetermined by the total number of features and random_state. It will then pick the best one to split from, and split into two child nodes. This process repeats for each child node and eventually terminates if one of the limitations set by our hyperparameters is met, or if the node is pure (containing data from only one class). Let's say we train T with 100 non-constant features, and suppose the predetermined feature indices are [2, 99, 53, 15, 76] for the root node, [17, 22, 23, 81, 59] for its left child, and [47, 34, 65, 16, 67] for its right child. For simplicity of illustration, assume the usefulness of a feature increases as the index increases. Additionally, assume that max_depth is set to two. The set of three features T ends up splitting by is [99, 81, 67]. Now if we add 50 constant features, and assign them ids 100 to 149. Say the predetermined sequence with 150 total number of features is [104, 134, 85, 29, 3] for the root node, [0, 39,124, 91, 56] for its left child, and [94, 20, 100, 4, 80] for its right child. Since a splitter ignores a constant feature when it sees one, features with id ≥ 100 will not be picked even though they take up space as one of the five features a node can examine. The set of three features T ends up splitting by in this scenario is [85, 91, 94], which is different from the first scenario and is an overall more useful set. What happened to T generalizes to all trees in the forest, and will hence change the forest’s performance. Adding constant features affects feature usefulness in two ways: In conclusion, whether a set of constant features is included will affect a forest's performance. In a way, having a lot of constant features will add more randomness to the forest, because at each node, the max_features is effectively changing randomly. Beware of this effect next time you consider constant features as irrelevant.  "
